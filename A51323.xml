            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rethren and Beloved in our Lord Jeſus, theſe Sermons as they were preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, even ſo was their Publication earneſtly ſollicited by ſome of you, at whoſe requeſt I have yeelded to that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned not in their Preaching, nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have done long ſince that task was finiſhed: But remembring I am not only a Debtor to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> but more eſpecially to you alſo, not onely by one means, but by every means, to endeavour your furtherance in the Faith, I judged my ſelf obliged to help you with that Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the Lord gave you in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And I may ſafely ſay, ſo near as I could, your Eys now have only what once
<pb facs="tcp:30532:3"/>your Ears heard. As to you my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whoſe importunity prevailed upon me to undertake this Work, know two Arguments prevailed upon me to Anſwer your Requeſt; The one, My Love towards you; the other, My deſire of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eternal Welfare; and if my Labour of Love for your ſakes may provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially extend or reach to the advantage of any others that love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, I therein ſhall and will rejoyce. I need not here give you any account of the Nature of this Treatiſe, you well know, it is to open both the Wiſe-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the Wiſe-Hearers Work and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; you know I need the one, and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo judge you want not need ſufficient to learn the other: As to the Method it is and ought to be plain, as beſt becoming Goſpel-Myſteries; 'twas Truth, not Humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Eloquence that I deſigned to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; and ſurely ſhould I thus have acted, I ſhould have pull'd down with one hand what I was ſetting up with the other, and ſo ſhould have been found a tranſgreſſor: As to my often hinting of any thing mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Diſcourſe, know the nearneſs of the Phraſes in the Text one to another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained it, except I ſhould have broke the
<pb facs="tcp:30532:3"/>bounds, and dealt partially with the Text; and my thoughts are, that Plenty may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conduce to Profit: And as for thoſe Phraſes, Titles, and Denominations of Perſons, which in this Diſcourſe may ſeem unto any tender ear to be plain, harſh, or reproachful to any, know this, I have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſidered to faſten them only on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons really deſerving ſuch names; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have herein followed the footſteps of the Saints &amp; Penmen of the Scripture, yet have I abated, rather than exceeded their practice; as is moſt evident, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome expreſſions wherein how great or learned or ſeemingly pious ſoever ſome ſinners were, yet both Chriſt himſelf, and the Prophets and Apoſtles, have ſpoken very home and hard againſt ſuch Perſons, ſtiling them <hi>Hypocrites, Devils Children, Wolves, Dogs, Lyons, Foxes, Vipers, painted-Sepulchres, whited Walls, Princes of Sodom, Rulers of Gomorrah, Adulterers, Adultereſſes,</hi> and ſuch like, as the Scripture witneſſeth; wherefore marvel not at my freedom of expreſſion to ſinners of the ſame dye. And laſtly, My reſolution was to avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof due to ſuch as give flattering Titles unto men; and as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's perſon; neither
<pb facs="tcp:30532:4"/>let me give flattering titles unto men; for I know not to give flattering titles; forin ſo doing my Maker would ſoon take me away,</hi> Job 32.21, 22. And further, If any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have in this Diſcourſe affected and diſcovered a Spirit of ſingularity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinion from the moſt of even pious, judicious, and ſober men of this Age. I Anſwer in uprightneſs, 'twas not affectedly but conſtrainedly done, and I ſuppoſe even ſuch Objectors will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, 'tis better differing from men, how wiſe ſoever, than from Chriſt; and ſince all men know but in part, and Propheſie but in part, that may be Chriſt's Truth which is not acknowledged or underſtood by many; is it not written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a cauſe, to decline after many, to wreſt judgment,</hi> Exod. 23.2. and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. I ſhall willingly receive bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information, and then ſpeedily change my preſent apprehenſion. Laſtly, If any Object againſt the largeneſs of this Tract; my Anſwer is, 'Twas my deſire to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, could I with fidelity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have effected it; and the truth is, I have denyed my ſelf, and ſlipt over ſome
<pb facs="tcp:30532:4"/>Particulars, which might more largel have been inſiſted on, that this Exception might have been ſpared: And now my dearly Beloved, whoſe importunity begat me this labour, Let me now crave leave, before I conclude this Epiſtle, to requeſt a few things of you. <hi>Firſt,</hi> My Brethren, if you meet with any Advantage, Content, or Comfort, by peruſing theſe Lines, pray give all the praiſe and glory to God, whoſe hand alone hath wrought it, and whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath revealed it; and think often upon 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.10, <hi>to</hi> 16. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pray be not only knowers of theſe Truths, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſame. Oh, be not only ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, but ſo practiſing; alſo let the height of Holineſs in this Diſcourſe diſcovered, be your main buſineſs to attain, ſo ſhall I not want a good reward for this my labour. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Labour to train up and educate your Families in this good knowledge of the Lord, and ſhew them the good old way, wherein they ſhould walk with God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9.10. ſaying, <hi>Only take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy Soul dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thy heart all the dayes of thy life; but teach them thy Sons, and thy Sons Sons: Eſpecially the
<pb facs="tcp:30532:5"/>day that thou ſtoodeſt before the Lord thy God in</hi> Horeb, <hi>when the Lord ſaid unto me, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the dayes that they ſhall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> with 11, 19. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Wonder not, neither be ſtumbled, if you find theſe Truths evil ſpoken of, ſcorned, traduced; but remember, this was to be expected in ſuch a day as this. And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> Forget not him that you have prevailed upon, but in all your ſupplications remember me, and pray for me, both night and day, that I may be faithful to the Death, that I may be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Spirit, that I may be abundant in the Work of the Lord, and that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may be acceptable and ſuccesful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints, that ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and not with grief, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God. And thus with my Prayers for you alſo, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them which are Sanctified.</p>

            <p>My end and ground, both in Preaching and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Sermons, was an inward motion to follow the movings and workings of the Spirit upon my Soul, in conformity to thoſe I read of in <hi>2 Pet. 1.21.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> 'Tis truth, as hath been already owned. When theſe Sermons were Preached, I thought not of Printing; but ſince being called upon ſo to do, I judged it my duty, as one of Chriſt's living Creatures, to walk ſtreight forward whither the Spirit was to go, and not to turn when going, <hi>Ezek. 1.12.</hi> As for my great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs, yea, exceeding great unfitneſs for ſuch a work, I profeſs I am not unſenſible of it, neither ſhall be aſhamed to own it to any that ſhall object it; yet notwithſtanding, ſince God deſpiſeth not the day of ſmall things, and will accept of what a man hath, and not of what a man hath not, wherefore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be found faithful, as becomes him that is a Steward, not forgetting what the Lord ſaid to <hi>Ezekiel, Son of Man, I have made thee a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>therefore hear the Word at my Mouth, and give them warning from me,</hi> Chap. <hi>3.17.</hi> The Style is low, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod plain, and the Argument ſomewhat bold and impartial; wonder not at it, it being moſt like him that did it, even one who was reſolved to be one of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Scholars in this Work; to wit, <hi>Not to come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If any think due reſpect hath not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently been ſhown to Superiors, let me ſay to ſuch, my aim and utmoſt endeavour hath been, not to offend or over-look ſuch, but to give unto <hi>Ceſar</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to peruſe, ſoberly and throughly, theſe lines; and know here is Milk for Babes, and ſtronger Meat for ſtronger Ones. And let me tell you, God is now ſpeaking to you, and ſaying to you as of old, <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, and make known my words unto you,</hi> Prov. <hi>1.22, 23.</hi> 'Tis now your day of Grace, Jeſus Chriſt is wooing all his People to come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but if ye will not hear, and fear, and repent your ſelves, ye muſt be ſure to partake of her judgment as well as of her ſins, <hi>Rev. 18.4.</hi> O! do not think Superſtition, or Idolatry, or Will-worſhip, or mens invention in God's Worſhip a ſmall ſin; but remember that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word, <hi>Do we provoke the Lord? are we ſtronger than he?</hi> (O no) <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10.22.</hi> Gal. <hi>6.10.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do nothing partially in the matter of Religion; be not circumſpect about Doctrine, and careleſs about Diſcipline or Church wayes; be not ſtrict for ſecond-Table-Duties,

            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with the opening or clearing of any obſcurity in the Text at this time; but refer that till afterwards, where more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently I may diſpatch it; but ſhall proceed to ſome Doctrines, or Concluſions hence obſervable. The firſt is taken from the firſt word, or Preface, <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</hi> We may take theſe words not only litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſpoken of the Typical <hi>Solomon;</hi> but as Prophetical, and pointing at a greater than <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> our Lord Jeſus, <hi>That ſo ſpake as never man ſpake,</hi> John 7.46. And alſo we might eye theſe words as dogmatical, or inſtructing what every Wiſe Goſpel-Preacher ought to be and do; whence we may collect thus much.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That the Lord is not ſparing or ſcant in means of Grace to his Church and People; but hath provided, and doth afford them one, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means of help, and advantage for Soul-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God, as God, hath in Mercy and Wiſdom dealt with the Second Creation and ſtate of Grace, as with the firſt Creation. In Nature he hath not made ſingle Fruits, Flowers, Plants, Grain, or Beaſts, Birds, or Fiſhes, but innumerable in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and manifold in kind; even ſo great variety and plenty, that even the wiſeſt of Moraliſts or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30532:11"/>Naturaliſts ſcarce knew what need or end there is even of that variety or plenty, unleſs to commend the Creator. Men are often times at a loſs how to improve, and not deſpiſe that plenty: Even ſo is it in ſpiritual and ſupernatural things; Men are ſo fully provided of them, that they even ſurfeit and are wanton under God's Divine Ordinances and Proviſions of Grace, as once <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of <hi>Manna;</hi> yet it ſeems good to God, to have <hi>moreovers,</hi> and to miniſter himſelf in manifold wiſdom to his People. To inſtance, thus God dealt with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he gave them not onely <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Aaron</hi> alſo; not onely Sacrifice, but Circumciſion alſo; nor Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, but the Paſſeover alſo; nor the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but the Temple alſo; not onely Prieſts and Levites, but Prophets and Nazarites likewiſe: That ſo God might ſay as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. <hi>What could I have done more for my Vineyard, which I have not done?</hi> And this <hi>Job</hi> tells you, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.14, 15. So <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 9th of his <hi>Proverbs.</hi> Even ſo hath he done under the Goſpel, not tying us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Way or Means, but affords us various Means and Seaſons. We have the Heaven and the Earth declaring his Glory and Handywork, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. Alſo we have the Law and Statutes of God in his Scripture, which is able to make the Man of God wiſe unto Salvation. We have alſo the Law written in our hearts. We have Inſtruments without, and Inſtincts within. We have the Word and Men without, and the Spirit within. We have Mercy and Judgment, all whiſpering to us, <hi>Fear ye the Lord.</hi> So that we may truly ſay, God as well as Man hath his <hi>Moreovers.</hi> And we ſerve not a hard Maſter, nor is our reproof and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30532:11"/>deſtruction leſs than ſufficiently of our ſelves. Now the Grounds and Reaſons why God walks thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his People are briefly theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. That the Glory of the Wiſdom, Power, and Bounty of God might the more gloriouſly appear, by the riches of his Liberality, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Proviſions afforded to his People, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. God makes his Proviſions to be very large and plentiful, affording us <hi>moreovers,</hi> to the end that we might with the more eaſe and facility do his Will, and attain the knowledge and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Salvation; ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.9, 10, 11, 12. and this the Apoſtle ſeems to eye, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. And the Prophet <hi>Micah, Chap.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. Chriſt ſaith, His <hi>Yoke is eaſie, and his Burthen light;</hi> becauſe he affords light ſufficient to ſee it with, and ſtrength enough to do what is required, and helps many to aſſiſt us; and rewards full, and rich enough to quicken and incourage us. But again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The Lord doth it to comply with our nature and frailty, which is not ſo well ſatisfied, nor ſo effectually furthered or helped by one Way or Means, as by diverſity and variety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vouchſafeth us his <hi>Moreovers,</hi> or Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. And laſtly, It is to ſtop the Mouth and leave ſilent and inexcuſable all neglecters and deſpiſers of Goſpel-Grace and Proviſions; ſince God can ſay to all ſuch, <hi>What need I have done more than what I have done?</hi> This God pleads for himſelf, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. and <hi>Luke</hi> 13.7, 8, 9.</p>

               <head>The firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is of Information.</head>
               <p>By way of Improvement or Application briefly; let this firſt admoniſh us to believe how inexcuſable wicked and ungodly Men and Women are, who have God's overpluſes and <hi>moreovers;</hi> I mean, that living under the light of the Goſpel among the Saints, enjoy ſuch means to better them, and change them; and yet remain ignorant, profane, and ungodly. Will not all this preſent favour and goodneſs of God to them, one day riſe up in judgment againſt them, and be an aggravation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6. Oh! let ſuch think ſeriouſly and timely upon two Scriptures, and I ſhall ſay no more to this Uſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it; ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes;</hi> compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once inlightned, and have taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; ſeeing they crucified to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. For the Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth Herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed receiveth bleſſing from God: But that which beareth Thorns and Briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi>

I beſeech you take heed of ſuch thoughts, leſt God takes away our plenty, and give us ſcarcity enough: Oh let me perſwade ſuch wanton Chriſtians to take the Counſel <hi>Peter</hi> gives to <hi>Simon Magus; Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> Acts 8.22, 23. Oh Friends! take heed of ſuch thoughts, of ſuch vain, yea, vile thoughts, for ſurely we are not grown ſuch quick Learners or good Scholars, or ſo ſoon taught what the good and perfect Will of the Lord is, as to conclude, we need few Preachers, or little Preaching. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Preaching of the Goſpel ſuch a mean Excellency, as worth little more than to be deſpiſed; or hath the Lord Chriſt given Gifts to men in vain: Oh no; he that hath given Gifts to many, not to one, he well knew many Preachers were neceſſary, that by here a little, and there a little, by Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept, becauſe the People are ſo hard to learn, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.9. Therefore the Lord hath conferred upon the Church diverſity of Gifts, though they proceed from one Spirit: He hath ſet in his Church not only Teachers, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets alſo; and dare we deſpiſe Prophets or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyings,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30532:13"/>and ſay, What need have we of theſe Miniſtrations? Hath the Lord given diverſly, as to Degrees or Meaſures, to one three, to another five Tallents, and ſhall he that hath received the leaſt, be thought unmeet to have the freedom to improve his Meaſure for his Lords Honour, or his Brethrens Advantage? or, where the Lord beſtows a larger Meaſure, and his Servants are faithful in the Stewardſhip thereof; dare any ſay the time is waſte, and the Meſſage too long? Not remembring, that although he that can ſpeak but five words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly, muſt be accepted; yet he which can ſpeak ten, muſt not be muzled or reſtrained. Chriſt, and his Spirit, ought to be free; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember that ſaying of <hi>Paul, Let no man blame us in this abundance which is adminiſtred by us,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.20. And to cure this evil, take this ſhort direction, Be more ſenſible of your want of the means of Grace, and more humble ſpirited, truly hungring and thirſting after Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let it be a word of Exhortation, If our Means and Proviſions be abundant, and redundant, let not our fruitfulneſs be ſhort, leſt what the Lord Jeſus ſaid to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſay to us alſo, <hi>The Kingdom ſhall he taken from you, and given to a People bringing forth the Fruit thereof, and he let out his Vineyard to other Husbandmen,</hi> Matth. 21.34, 41, 43. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8. How dreadful then will thy ſtate and mine be, to enjoy much means of Grace, and to bring forth none or little Fruit by it: Oh! conſider this all you that forget God. So much for the firſt Particular, or word in the Text, <hi>Moreover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30532:13"/>Now let us conſider the next Particular, which contains the Reaſon of what the Preacher ſaid or did, that is in theſe words, <hi>Becauſe the Preacher was Wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I go further, Three things need ſome clearing or Expoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> How this ſuits with ſome other of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Expreſſions, for <hi>Solomon</hi> to commend himſelf, or to ſay the Preacher was Wife, or Painful, yea, Uſeful alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> What a Preacher is, or what this Preacher was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> What this Wiſdom is that is here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of the <hi>firſt</hi> thing, Though this Book is <hi>Solomons,</hi> and bears his Name, and was by him Compoſed, yet is it not clear that this Copy, or theſe Words, were his own: But as <hi>David</hi> and other Kings had their Scribes and Pen-men which did write for them, and wrote after them; even ſo might <hi>Solomon,</hi> and doubtleſs had, as his Story in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.3. compared with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.29. doth declare. And ſo though he did not, yet they well might ſet him forth. But ſecondly, Although in moral reſpects, and at ſome time it is not fit for a man to commend himſelf, yet in two reſpects a man may (eſpecially a Preacher) ſo do, and be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in ſo doing: Firſt, in caſe of ſcandal, he may vindicate himſelf from unjuſt aſperſion and reproach: So <hi>Samuel</hi> did; the people had clouded and eclipſed his worthy and innocent Government, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.4, 5. therefore, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. he vindicates himſelf. So alſo did <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 7. ſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30532:14"/>that of <hi>Job</hi> 29. Secondly, In furtherance of man's Work or Imployment, a man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf: So <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. and it <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.12, to 19. with <hi>chap.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9.

                  </gap> thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> acted, in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 14 to the cloſe of the Chapter. And thus I conceive if <hi>Solomon</hi> did commit this to the Churches Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, from his own Hand or Pen, in this latter ſenſe he might humbly and innocently do it. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> words be thus read, this difficulty is eaſily avoided and the ſenſe preſerved intire. Moreover, <hi>A Wiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Preacher will ſtill give good heed,</hi> and ſo it ſpeak Duty, and not Commendation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me a little open this Particular, <hi>What a Preacher is,</hi> or, <hi>this Preacher was</hi> that here is ſpoken of. A Preacher is not onely ſuch as are under Miniſterial Unction, or calling in Office o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Miniſtry. But a Preacher is any, or every ſuch Perſon or Diſciple of Chriſt that hath received Gifts of the Spirit to profit withal, and is able to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to him that is weary, for Edification, Exhortation, and Comfort; and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in Scripture are called Prophets, or Propheſying. Preachers, as in that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. And ſuch a Prophetical or Propheſying. Preacher was <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Preacher in my Text, and not an Official, Ordained, or Miniſterial. Preacher, for ſuch were only at that time the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> the High Prieſt, Prieſts, and Prophets Extraordinary. But the Book tells us, this Preacher was by Office a King, not a Prieſt; he was onely a Prophet, or Membral Preacher, even ſuch a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30532:14"/>Preacher as that Church had many of, and any Brother or Member of that Church, who was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though not ſo able, might as freely and as lawfully preach as <hi>Solomon,</hi> as that paſſage <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>Ye men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the People, ſay on:</hi> And ſuch Preachers <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> allowed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.29. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Envieſt thou for my ſake? Would God that all the Lord's people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them;</hi> compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29, 31. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak, and let the other judge, for ye may all propheſie one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</hi> Many other Teſtimonies may be added, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſhall ſpeak to this more hereafter, let this at preſent ſuffice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing to be cleared is, <hi>What this Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is,</hi> or what is this Wiſdom that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith the Preacher had, and what that Wiſdom is that every Preacher ought to have, that will thus wiſely or profitably Preach. Wiſdom, as <hi>Solomon</hi> phraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, doth not onely excel Folly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.13. but Wiſdom alſo excels Wit. Wit is a quickneſs or acuteneſs of the Underſtanding to catch or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend things by. But Wiſdom is that depth of Reaſon and Judgment, whereby Apprehenſions, Thoughts, Sciences, Purpoſes, and Buſineſſes are begun and compleated, or are honourably, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and regularly performed. A Fool may have Wit, only a Wiſe Man can have Wiſdom, or carry on his Deſign or Buſineſs wiſely.</p>
               <p>But ſtill the Queſtion is, <hi>What Wiſdom that is that is here treated of? or is Preaching Wiſdom,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30532:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>even that Wiſdom without which a man cannot be competent or profitable Preacher?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Had not this been God's Ordinance, that the Word by Men ſhould be Preached or Revealed unto men, the beſt of men would never have been found ſo often, even in all Ages, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing againſt the God of men, through preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto men; but the beſt of men have preached unto men. The Scripture ſhews us this in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, in that he was called a <hi>Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.5. The like is ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. where <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Teaching or Preaching, in and to his Houſhould, is made the reaſon of God's Preaching or Declaring to him the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The like we have in <hi>chap.</hi> 49.1, 2.

Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Preaching is, and ever was, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged God's Ordinance.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30532:17"/>was a Preacher, and did frequently preach; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Preaching is God's Ordinance.

                  </gap> be his Ordinance: But God hath in all Ages fitted ſome men for Preaching-Work; therefore Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Work is God's Ordinance. The proof of this lies moſt apparent in the firſt Argument, and is confirmed further to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.11. <hi>The Lord gave the Word, great was the Company of them that publiſhed it;</hi> compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 12. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men: For the Perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Yea, he that ſaith, <hi>No man lighteth a Candle</hi> in vain, or <hi>to put it under a Buſhel;</hi> Would not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf light ſo many Preaching-Candles, or make

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Satan and ſinners would never have ſo oppoſed Preaching, had not Satan known that Preaching was God's Ordinance: Satan oppoſes not ſin, no not the groſſeſt wickedneſs; but the pureſt and the moſt powerful Preachers and Preaching he hath alwayes moſt eagerly oppoſed; witneſs <hi>Micah, Zechariah, Jeremiah, Peter, Paul, Stephen:</hi> And which of Chriſt's eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Preachers hath he not perſecuted? witneſs <hi>Acts</hi> 13.49, 50. <hi>And the Word of the Lord was publiſhed throughout all the Regions; but the Jews ſtirred up the devout and honourable Women, and the chief Men of the City, and raiſed perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and expelled them out of their Coaſts;</hi> compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 17. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. Yea, our own Times witneſs this, how much the deſign of the Devil and his Creatures is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and hinder the Spiritual Preaching of the Goſpel: Like the Men <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Who both killed the Lord Jeſus and their own Prophets, and have perſecuted us, forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved, to fill up their ſins; for the Wrath is come upon them to the utmoſt.</hi>

I might add that which not onely good Men have both practiſed, and been perſecuted for; yea, both the Lord himſelf, and Angels have practiſed and Preached to us, as our Work, that muſt needs be God's Ordinance; but this both Chriſt and his Apoſtles have taught and injoyned us: Therefore to Preach is their Duty, as they are able to Preach. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go, and teach

               <p>A third Uſe of Reproof, from this conſideration, that Preaching of the Word is God's Ordinance, ſhall be, to reprove all ſuch Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as though not forbidden of men, yet forbid themſelves, and neglect this ſo great a Work, and Ordinance, as the Preaching of the Goſpel. Such idle Drones among the Bees, had need conſider that word 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>For though I Preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of, for neceſſity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I Preach not the Goſpel:</hi> and woe will be unto ſuch as are able, and may, but do not preach the Goſpel. Yea, though men did forbid, yet woe unto him that will be forbidden by any ſort of men, and doth not faithfully and fully preach the Goſpel. Such ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, idle, timerous, or unprofitable Preachers, that do not as the good Preacher did in my Text, and every good Preacher in the World ought to

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30532:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>this day what I ſhall affirm, till you can more ſubſtantially oppoſe it; to wit, That it is lawful and laudable, a Liberty, yea, a Duty incumbent upon every Man that feareth the Lord, and hath received the Gift, to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon for Edification, Exhortation, and Comfort, to uſe and exerciſe the Gifts he hath received of the Lord in Propheſying or Preaching in the Congregation, <hi>That all may learn, and all may be edified,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.31.

               <p>But a ſecond Uſe, and the all that I ſhall make of this Doctrine, is, That if Propheſying or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Brethren, or ſuch as have not received any Office or Miniſtry from Chriſt, be an Ordinance of Chriſt, and the duty of ſuch as have received Gifts for Preaching to Preach. Then two things from hence I may add,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A word of Exhortation to all the Churches of the Saints, to allow, admit, and incourage the Gifted-Brethren in this Work and Buſineſs of Preaching. Oh! be not ſo like to Antichriſt and his Synagogue, as to forbid this liberty of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30532:31"/>Saints, which Chriſt hath ſo dearly purchaſed with his moſt precious Blood. Conſider what the Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Anſwer of Chriſt, <hi>Forbid him not,</hi> Mark 9.38, 39. Will not Chriſt have ſuch forbad that follow not him, or his Diſciples, and will you my Brethren forbid ſuch as follow the Lamb, (yea, and follow you too) becauſe not Miniſters as you are, or competent or equal in Gifts with you? My Brethren, I beſeech you do not this wickedneſs, it ſmells of <hi>Rome,</hi> of an Antichriſtian ſpirit; but think what the Lord ſaith, <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me; and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad,</hi> Mat. 12.30. You that will not joyn iſſue with Chriſt in furthering and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch to Preach whom Chriſt allows to Preach, you, even all you, who ever you be, how Wiſe, and Learned, and Pious ſoever, yet are you againſt Chriſt, and for Antichriſt; Enemies to Preaching, though never ſo great Preachers; and it were well you would pleaſe to ſuffer me to commend two Scriptures to your ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Be of the ſame mind one towards another; mind not high things, but condeſcend to men of low degree, or eſtate: Be not wiſe in your own conceits,</hi> Rom. 12.16. The ſecond Scripture is that of <hi>Peter, Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof; not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples to the Flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:30532:31"/>But ſecondly, Let this be a ſecond Branch of this Uſe to exhort all ſuch, even ſuch, or ſo many as have received but one Talent, or the leaſt dogree of real competency or fitneſs, though neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets or Prophets Sons, but of the meaneſt or moſt contemptible condition or Calling amongſt men to Preach, and that in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. O remember it is your duty, your Priviledge, you may preach all one by one; you are not only made Kings, but Prieſts; and this Prieſtly Act you, yea, any Gifted Believer may perform, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. Beloved, Preaching is God's Ordinance, his Peoples Bleſſing, and your Duty. O therefore! Preach as well as Pray continually, &amp; forget not that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>As every Man hath received the Gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold Grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. Brethren, let not your fellow Spies diſcourage you, by telling you of the Sacredneſs, Excellency, and difficulty of Preaching; <hi>But as every man hath received, ſo miniſter the ſame, as of the ability God giveth, that in all things God may be glorified,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.11. Remembring, for your encouragement, two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>For if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted, according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Think on theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>For unto every one that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath,</hi> Mat. 25.29. Therefore <hi>quench not the Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.19. But what the Diſciple ſaid, I may ſay to you, <hi>The Lord hath need of it,</hi> Luke 19.34. The Souls of Sinners call for your Labours; yea, the wants of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30532:32"/>your dear Brethren call for your words of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Edification, and Comfort; therefore, be not wanting in the practice of this Ordinance, even this great Ordinance of Preaching the Goſpel. <hi>Therefore, my Brethren, be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the Work of the Lord; for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> much as you know your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let this Doctrine exhort and quicken you that have ears to hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches. Take heed that you <hi>deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.20. Chriſtians, deſpiſe not Chriſt's day of ſmall things, Since <hi>out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings, he will ordain ſtrength, becauſe of the enemy and avenger,</hi> Pſalm. 8.2. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. Say not in your hearts as once <hi>Nathaniel</hi> did; <hi>Can any good thing come out of</hi> Nazareth? John 1.46. But <hi>take heed you deſpiſe not him that ſpeaketh on Earth,</hi> leſt that ſad word be your word, <hi>For with ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering lips, and another tongue, will he ſpeak to this People.</hi> Read that Chapter at your leaſure, and you ſhall ſee how dreadful God ſpeaks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of this Ordinance of Preaching, though by mean and outwardly contemptible Inſtruments: My Beloved, know God oft-times hangs great Bleſſings at the end of ſmall Wyers. How great a victory did God give <hi>Iſrael</hi> by that Barley Cake, as <hi>Gideon</hi> is called, Judg. 7.13, 14, 15, 16. As alſo how great a Bleſſing did <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> receive, by hearing the Voice of his Servants, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. Yea, how great advantage did this very Ordinance bring to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> when the ſcattered Saints and Brethren went up and down, Preaching
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30532:32"/>and Propheſying, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19, 20, 21. Therefore deſpiſe not Propheſying, I mean Preaching, by Brethren that are gifted thereunto, although not Miniſters or Officers in the Churches. So much for this ſecond Doctrine.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now come to ſpeak to the third Point, or Doctrine, which is,</p>
               <p>Doct. 3. <hi>That if Preaching be God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and Propheſying and Preaching by Men of Grace and Gifts, though no Miniſters, or Ordained Perſons, may lawfully Preach; then ſuch as are Prophets, though no Miniſters or Officers of the Church, not only may, but ought to Preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe I have ſpoke ſomething to this in the cloſe of the ſecond Doctrine, I ſhall ſay no more to this, but proceed to the fourth and laſt Doctrine upon this Head, which is drawn from the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the qualification of this Prophetical Preacher <hi>Solomon;</hi> to wit, That he was Wiſe, as you have it in the Text, <hi>Moreover, becauſe the Preacher was Wiſe.</hi> Whence take this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit,</p>
               <p>Doct. 4. <hi>That every Goſpel preacher ought to be truly wiſe, or that Grace and Spiritual Wiſdom are the true and onely, and ſufficient Requiſites or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency for Goſpel-preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me, in the carrying on this Work, firſt clear this Point, and ſhew what this Wiſdom, which every Preacher ought to have, is.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, Give the Reaſons why what is affirmed to be the Wiſdom required, is that which is affirmed.</p>

               <p>Now I come to open the Point, and ſhew you what it is to be Wiſe, or what that Wiſdom is that every Goſpel-Preacher ought to have. I told you in the opening of the words, by way of Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Wiſdom ſpoken of in the Text, was neither natural, moral, or acquired Wiſdom, as Languages, Tongues, Arts, or Sciences; but a more ſublime and tranſcendent Wiſdom. I told you, God had not ſet this Ax or Hammer apart to do his or this Work with; theſe Tools are ſtrangers to any Divine deſignment for ſuch an end, being neither appointed or required in Scripture. I told you ſecondly, This Wiſdom is but a carnal or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Weapon, and is only meet for carnal, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, weak, and worldly work; and for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this Learning or Wiſdom is very fit and uſeful, but no more apt or neceſſary eſſentially for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Preaching, than a Sword is to cut ones Beard with, or a Plough to ride a Journey on: But the Wiſdom abſolutely neceſſary for Preaching, or a Preacher, is Divine Wiſdom, as I told you, which deſcends from Above more immediately, and comes from the Father of Lights; and this is that true Wiſdom which is put in oppoſition to the Wiſdom before mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt ſent him not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel; not with wiſdom of words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be of none effect:</hi> Mark, it's worldly Wiſdom, or the wiſdom of

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Humane Wiſdome or Learning be eſſential to qualifie a Preacher for preaching, then the <hi>Scripture</hi> Rule concerning a <hi>Preachers</hi>-qualification is imperfect and obſcure, which is ſinful to imagine; becauſe it neither requireth, or provideth for ſuch low, earthly-membring Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> which teaches Preachers not to preach without it: What the <hi>Scripture</hi> requires as a Preachers Qualification, you may read 1 <hi>Acts</hi> 4.5.

               <p>But again, I pray conſider, when <hi>Paul</hi> directs to the choice of Miniſters, I mean, Preaching-Miniſters, he doth not once name or remember this great <hi>Diana,</hi> I mean, humane Learning, but layes down Rules for choice without this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</p>

For grant that theſe places intended Colledges and Univerſities, and ſuch like places, yet it follows not that theſe were places imployed or improved for Trayning, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Perſons for Goſpel-preaching; for it doth not appear that any Goſpel-preachers iſſued forth from thence.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, The Prophets and Propheteſſes we read of, were extraordinary Prophets, and not ſuch Preachers or Prophets as the Doctrine intends and ſpeaks of; but if Schools and Univerſities will fit us to be ſuch Prophets as can declare things to come from the Lord, then let us all, that fear the Lord, go to theſe Schools that we may learn thus to Propheſie. But this is not a mediate, but an immediate Gift, either by Dreams, Viſions, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, By the ſame way and means that the unlearned People of the Lord come to know it; and it concerns them, and is neceſſary for them to know, though I ſay not of the ſame neceſſity. For if they be not aſſured that the Scriptures, as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, are rightly tranſlated; what ſhall they build their Faith on, except on their learned Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Tranſlators honeſty and ability? and this is to pin their Faith in a buſineſs of moſt weight and concernment, on the Prieſts ſleeve; and this is but to believe as the Church believes, and ſo the blind leading the blind, they may both fall into the Ditch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, It is not by knowing Arts and Sciences, or Languages, Preachers or People, can come to be aſſured that the Scriptures are the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30532:40"/>Word of God, and rightly tranſlated; but by the humble, ſanctified, and diligent ſearching into, and ſtudying of the Scriptures; 'tis by comparing things ſpiritually together, as the Apoſtle tells us, ſaying, <hi>Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which Man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.13. I ſay, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord Jeſus muſt we, nay, may we know the Power and Spirit, Truth and Purity of the Scriptures; and it is the Godly judicious, Spiritual Chriſtian, beſt knows how aptly or corruptly they are tranſlated.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, I Anſwer, Grant this were ſo, which I do not grant, yet this Learning and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is more requiſite and eſſential to a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator, Examiner or Corrector of tranſlated Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, than to a Goſpel-preacher.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, Since ſo many thouſand Learned, as well as Godly, have ſealed the Truth of the Scriptures Purity, and Divine Authority, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all its humane Imperfections in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation; therefore we need not now, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Univerſity-Learning to do that Work which is already ſufficiently done to our hands.</p>

               <p>I Anſwer, As a Lanthorn without a Candle will no way help to ſhew a man his way, though a Candle without a Lanthorn may, no more can this dark Lanthorn of humane Learning and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, without the Candle of the Lord, as too abundant experience hath witneſſed; but that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30532:40"/>Candle ſingly can and doth. Miſerable Experience ſheweth what Interpreters the School-men and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been; and yet are even the Fathers of well-nigh all the Individual Errors in Judgment and Practice in the European World. The Devil and the Learned may be admired for them, if for any thing; but take ſome Scriptures for proof of ſo weighty a Point, when our Lord comes to ſhew how Miniſters and Interpreters of Scripture ſhall be furniſhed for this Work, he ſaith, <hi>When the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak, and he ſhall ſhew you things to come,</hi> John 16.13. The like Teſtimony gives <hi>Paul, But we ſpeak the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the World unto our Glory, which none of the Princes of this World knew; for had they known it, they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. But ſome may ſay, How came the Preachers of the Goſpel in that day to this Wiſdom? Not from Univerſities or humane Learning, but from the Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, as you have it; <hi>But God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, mark it, yea, the deep things of God,</hi> verſ. 10.

               <p>Now Beloved, I pray you do but conſider what is ſaid in this Objection, and you have here diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the learned Man's Excellency, it is to ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate and deal fallaciouſly with the Simple and the Truth. Beloved, take heed of them as ſuch who have learned the skill to deceive the ſimple. But yet a little further to Anſwer this ſeemingly ſo weighty an Objection. Know God's way, or the right way for a Preacher to anſwer Gain-ſayers, is to have the Word of God dwell richly in him in all wiſdom, that out of that Library or good Treaſure, he may be able to convince them of the contrary part. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> taught, injoyning Preachers to <hi>hold faſt the faithful Word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able, by ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, both to exhort and convince the Gain-ſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9, 10. the like you have in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. Some may ſay, <hi>This is to ſubject Preachers, and Preaching to contempt and ſcorn: For if Preachers need not be learned, who will not be a Preacher? Who more bold than the ignorant, or men of ignorance? And who will reverence Preaching or Preachers, if it be ſo eaſie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a work for any man that is unlearned? Will it not be very ſimple, and mean Preaching, if Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers want Breeding, Arts, Languages, and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to garniſh and dreſs out their Preaching, with Lively and Apt Similes, Rhetorical and Elegant Words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:30532:41"/>To all which I thus Anſwer, in the fear of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is never the more eaſie, but much more the harder for any to Preach, whilſt we affirm no humane Acquirements, but ſupernatural Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that fits or qualifies Perſons for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If all, or any ſeek, or undertake to Preach, it follows not that all ſhall or can Preach: No, there are many Learned, yea, and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Intruders upon Preaching, which do not, nor can Preach; for all they ruſh or run upon the work; for it is written, <hi>A man can receive nothing,</hi> that is no ſuch Gift, <hi>except it be given him from Above,</hi> John 3.27. And ſaith <hi>Paul, How can one Preach except he be ſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thirdly, Though this unneceſſary Tool be laid aſide, yet are there many other helps, which every Preacher muſt have, both Natural and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, which every man hath not, no not every Godly Man, nor can attain to; therefore to be an Accompliſhed-Preacher is not ſo eaſie, though it matters not how eaſie.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, If it be ſaid, <hi>Who then will reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Preaching or Preachers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Though an undue reverence is not to be ſought or deſired, and every able Preacher is truly and moſt eminently worthy of reverence; yet when the Love of God, and the Work of God lies warm upon the Preachers heart; then the main buſineſs of a Goſpel-Preacher will be to get Chriſt, not himſelf, reverenced: <hi>For we Preach not our ſelves, but the Lord Jeſus, and our ſelves your Servants for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5. And
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30532:42"/>let me tell you, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Michael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. Even of the Hand-maids ſhall ſuch be had into honour, whilſt the proud Locuſts of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit deſpiſe them. I ſay, Every ſuch Soul that is Preached to, will reverence that lip which hath ſpoken Chriſt to his heart, as hereafter may more appear; but if the blind cannot, yet the ſeeing eye will reverence ſuch Preaching, and that the more, becauſe it is plain and ſimple.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, Whereas they tell us that Preaching will be very mean and ſimple if the Preachers be unlearned, and want Arts, Sciences, Rhetorick, and Logick, to help them to apt Expreſſions, Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to ſet forth Heavenly things by. I Anſwer, No, if men be wiſe that Preach, it will not be ſimple Preaching. If Preachers be dayes-men, or men of experience in Chriſt's Goſpel, and Satan's Wiles; for if the Spirit of God can help the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned to words ſufficient to ſpeak to God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſurely he is much more able to help the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Preacher to ſufficiency of words, to ſpeak to the Satisfaction and Advantage of unlearned, ſimple, ſinful, earthly, ignorant Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yea, Babes and Sucklings; therefore no need to ſerve an Apprentiſhip for Words at the Schools. Thus I have Anſwered this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 8. Some may ſay, <hi>If Preachers be not Scholars and Artiſts, there are many things in the Scripture which they cannot reſolve or explain, at the weights of the Sanctuary of old, and Places and Countries, as where they lie, and in what Continent, Scituation, Latitude and Diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:30532:42"/>To which I Anſwer, This is but ſuperfluous or unneceſſary Knowledge, which every Goſpel-Preacher may honourably be without. And if a Preacher cannot attain it without humane Learning, he may Preach as truly and as profitably Chriſt's Myſterie and Man's Duty from ſuch Scriptures, as if he could reſolve ſuch Riddles, or unneceſſary Queſtions. For could not <hi>Ezckiel, Amos,</hi> and the Prophets propheſie againſt <hi>Egypt, Tyrus, Moab, Babylon,</hi> and the reſt of the Heathen-Countries, as well as if they knew their Longitude or Latitude? Yes doubtleſs, as clearly as other-ways, for that did not concern them, but only to denounce the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt them; other knowledge of Places is onely or moſtly neceſſary for ſuch as are Travellers or Hiſtoriographers, who elſe may miſs their way, or mar their Work; but 'tis not ſo with a Preacher, 'tis enough for ſuch to Preach that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, becauſe ſhe hath ſinned, and that <hi>Nineveh</hi> repented, and therefore was ſpared; whereſoever the one or the other Country is, and that whatſoever Countrey or People ſoever they be that ſin againſt the moſt High, and do <hi>not repent, ſhall alſo periſh</hi> firſt or laſt; yea, even <hi>England,</hi> though we know where it lies, without repentance, muſt doubtleſs periſh.</p>

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:30532:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>I Anſwer, It is not to hate Knowledge, to cry up the Spirit's Teaching, and the Scriptures Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the beſt of Learning; and to cry down this empty, dangerous, ſmoaky, humane Learning; I ſay, 'tis not ſlighting or deſpiſing Learning, to diſtinguiſh and difference it from Spiritual and Heavenly Knowledge; to teach, that humane Learning, ſuch as the difference is about, is not neceſſary or helpful for Preaching, doth neither deny or imply that Learning is uſeful or leſs than a Gift of God, and uſeful as other natural Gifts and Excellencies are. Is that Plant good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not good for food, or delightful to ſmell on? Oh no, for it may be good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Phyſick: Even ſo is Learning, even this Learning in Controverſie, to teach men Civil and Political Government, or fit men for Magiſtracy, but dangerous for Goſpel-Preachers; good for Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Lawyers, Hiſtorians, Navigators, Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of Land, and the like, but needleſs for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; good for Travellers, Merchants, Souldiers, and the like, but not for Home-dwellers or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; doubtleſs there are many lawful and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſes for humane Learning, though this be ſpared; therefore I hope none will ſay I deſpiſe it, though I affirm it ought not to be injoyned or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as eſſentially neceſſary for Goſpel-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And thus I have endeavoured to Anſwer all ſuch Objections as I have met with, that are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which hath been offered; to wit, that humane, natural, or artificial Wiſdom or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not the Goſpel-Preachers Wiſdom mentioned in the Text, or that which will fit a man to be a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30532:43"/>Goſpel-Preacher, or qualifie unto Wiſe and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-preaching in the Negative.</p>
               <p>Let me in the Affirmative now declare what this Wiſdom is which every Goſpel-Preacher ought to have, and cannot be competently qualified unto Preaching without it; it is the ſaving, ſanctifying Grace of God, and Spiritual Gifts, and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God: This Divine Wiſdom is Eſſential Wiſdom for a Preacher; and having this Wiſdom, though without other Wiſdom, a Preacher may be ſufficiently accompliſhed unto Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Thus may I inform, whence the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and Learned Clergy-men of our day, do ſo blaſpheme and oppoſe the Spirits-Teaching; 'tis ſurely becauſe of their ignorance and ſinful intereſt.

And the ſame reaſon there was, why the Prieſts and Captains of the Temple, and the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees</hi> came and oppoſed and perſecuted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30532:47"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 4.1, 2. And even at this very day the ſame reaſon is, why the Prieſts and Prelates of our day do ſo exclaim and reproach the Spirits, teaching, and the Spiritual-Miniſters teaching. It is their own intereſt of profit, and ignorance of Truth, and right way of fitting men for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: though they are ignorant of God's Will in this thing, yet are they well acquainted, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this kind of Truth, and theſe ſort of Preachers, go up, their Trade, Honour, and Profits will ſoon go down; according to that ſaying, <hi>The Fruits which thy Soul luſteth after, are departed from thee, and all things which are dainty and goodly, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thee, and thou ſhalt find them no more at all,</hi> Rev. 18.14. And this is the reaſon why theſe covetous Clergy-men do ſo cry out againſt this way of Preaching by men ſpiritually wiſe, but otherwiſe illiterate and unlearned, becauſe ſuch Preachers, if allowed, will ſoon cloud their Glory, and eclips their Credit, and humble their Pride, and hinder their Markets; and who then can won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that theſe ſo reproach the true Goſpel-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they muſt blaſpheme and gnaw their tongues for pain; therefore it is not to be wondred at, as long as this Antichriſtian-Prieſthood endureth, as we have it <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. There can be no joy to them that dwell thus in, or upon earthly Things, Orders, Riches, Credit, and Authority: You may as well look for Peace from Hell, as from the Learned Romiſh-Prieſthood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceaſe marvelling, that the Pope's Clergy do ſo vilifie and reproach Chriſt's Goſpel Spiritually-wiſe Preachers, ſtiling them, proud, buſie-bodies in other mens buſineſs, ſelf-will'd, preſumptuous, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30532:47"/>factious, enemies to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and what not? that may render them odious, dealing with Chriſt's Miniſters, and faithful Preachers, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly their fore-Fathers dealt with that faithful Witneſs and Martyr of the Lord Jeſus <hi>John Huſs;</hi> who when they burned him, clad him in ſtrange Garments, painting Images of Devils upon him to make him odious to the People; as you have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Book of <hi>Martyrs.</hi>

Wherefore Brethren, look out men for this Work, full of the Holy Ghoſt and wiſdom, and them only appoint unto this buſineſs; diſhonour not Preaching, by ſending diſhonourable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers about Preaching Imployment; and miſtake not the Rule by which you ſhould judge who is wiſe and fit to make a Preacher: Judge not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appearance, or man's judgment, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what God ſaid to <hi>Samuel</hi> in the like caſe; <hi>Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his ſtature, becauſe I have refuſed him; for the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth; for man looketh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.7. Beloved, in this buſineſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who is fit to be admitted and allowed to Preach, conſult not with fleſh and blood, with the carnal, wiſe, and learned Rabies of the day, leſt like <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> you be miſtaken in your judgment, and call him <hi>God's Anointed,</hi> when the Lord ſaith, <hi>This is not the man;</hi> but conſult the Record and Charter of the New Teſtament, and ſee whom that Word calls Wiſe, and a man fit to Preach the Goſpel; and as hath been demonſtrated, you ſhall find
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30532:48"/>the Wiſdom which comes from Above, from the Father of Lights, is the onely Wiſdom that can fit perſons unto Preaching. Grace, and Gifts of the Spirit of God, are beſt qualifications for a Preacher, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5. He will make the beſt Preacher which hath moſt Grace and Gifts of the Spirit. Therefore take heed to this buſineſs, I beſeech you Brethren, who are Chriſt's Porters, ſee that no fooliſh, idle, or unholy Shepherds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at Chriſt's Doors, or be his Peoples Paſtors; for if there do, the ſin and guilt, yea, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment alſo of ſuch Preaching, will lie at your doors, <hi>John</hi> 10.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But me-thinks I hear ſome Object and ſay, <hi>This is prepoſterous, erroneous, and dangerous, to make Preachers to depend and ſpring from the Congregations Approbation and Miſſion; This were to make Miniſters or Preachers depend upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whereas, is it not better for Congregations to ſpring from, and depend upon the Miniſtry, or the Preachers and Diſpenſers of the Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, This Objection ſmells ſtrong of <hi>Rome,</hi> who-ever be the Objectors, and is calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Intereſt of the Clergy, to maintain their Pride, Authority, and Avarice, and therefore may the rather be ſuſpected to be Anti-ſcriptural, or of no great ſtrength to withſtand.</p>
               <p>Therefore firſt, Though theſe ſuggeſt this to be prepoſterous, as if we would put the Cart to draw the Horſes, and not the Horſes to draw the Cart: My Anſwer is, Natural and Divine Reaſon would judge the contrary; were it not prepoſterous that Servants ſhould judge and chuſe their Maſters; but Maſters that are to have their ſervice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30532:49"/>them their maintenance, ſhould be judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to queſtion or judge their ability. Is not the Houſe-holder more honourable than his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Servants, and the Houſe before the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Servants? Even ſo in the Church of Chriſt? Muſt Preachers and Miniſters be the Churches, as well as Chriſt's Servants; and ſhall not the Church be concluded honourable and wiſe enough to judge of the ability of her own Servants? Only they muſt judge whether the Church or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is fit for their Profit or Honour. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid: Muſt the Church maintain them, yet not call them to their work, and be allowed to judge of them? Yea, the Church muſt try their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and yet ſhall they not be equal or ſuperior to them, proved 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is not erroneous, but moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaint, and agreeable to Scripture, and then it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not what it is contrary to, or who calls it Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But that this is agreeable to Scripture, take <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> into conſideration, where <hi>Peter ſtanding up in the midſt of one hundred and twenty Diſciples, ſayes; Of theſe men that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among us, muſt one be choſen, or ordained, to be a witneſs with us of his Reſurrection;</hi> and they mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hundred and twenty, not the eleven; <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed two,</hi> Joſephus <hi>called</hi> Barſabas, <hi>who was ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named</hi> Juſtus, <hi>and</hi> Matthias, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 21, 22, 23. with <hi>chap.</hi> 18. from 24 to 28. Truth it is, this way of trying and ſending forth, and judging of the Preacher's Gifts, and fitneſs for Goſpel-Preaching, is an erring from the Canon of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>-Church, and their Book of Ordination of Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30532:49"/>but is no erring from the Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on of the New Teſtament, as hath been cleared. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas they ſay this Doctrine is dangerous; give me leave to ſay thereto, Truth is not endangered by tryal, or good commodity by being ſearched into. The wiſer, and more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Preachers are, the leſs danger of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scriptures, or enſnaring the people. If the Objectors intend the danger lies in this, <hi>That the ignorant People or Multitude of Believers being intruſted with this buſineſs, will chuſe ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer briefly, Their Rule in this buſineſs, prevents this Objection; For they muſt be wiſe that ought to be admitted to Preach; and the Church muſt not only be ſimple and ignorant, but undutiful and diſobedient to Chriſt's commands, or elſe this danger is avoided. And though <hi>Babylons</hi> Builders are blind in this matter, yet Chriſt's Church is wiſe, and ſeeing, and the Spiritual Man diſcerneth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15. And ſo much for this Objection.</p>

Firſt, and above all, Be much in Communion with God by Prayer for wiſdom, for <hi>every good and perfect Gift, cometh down from the Father of Lights;</hi> and your way to have it, is by Prayer: So ſaith <hi>James, If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, who giveth liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not,</hi> chap. 1.5. Beloved, all we that Preach, and all ye that deſire this great Work of Breaching, we do all of us lack wiſdom, yea, very much lack wiſdom; therefore pray, Oh pray, abundantly for wiſdom, that we may receive it: Thus did <hi>Solomon,</hi> and pleaſed God, and obtained his requeſt, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. And this, <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, deſired the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonian</hi>-Church do do for him; even to pray, that the Word of the Lord might have free courſe, and be glorified by him and his Companions.

                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Secondly, Would you be Spiritually wiſe? Be diligent, painful, and abundant in the ſtudy and ſearching into the Scriptures, for this is able, onely able, of outward helps, to make the Man of God wiſe, even throughly wiſe, unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,

Thus God acted towards <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.17.

               <p>
                  <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Fourthly, Be much in Communion with Saints: for with the well-adviſed is wiſdome, therefore if Preachers would be wiſe, they muſt walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the Righteous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Paul</hi> ſat at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and thus <hi>Apollos</hi> became wiſe through converſe with <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla;</hi> and thus <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> may be ſaid to become wiſe, by ſitting at the feet of our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.3. with <hi>chap.</hi> 18.25, 26. and <hi>Luke</hi> 10.25. So that if a Preacher
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30532:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſire to be wiſe, his way is to hold and maintain much Chriſtian-fellowſhip and Communion with the Saints, even with the wiſeſt and moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among them. This may ſerve for direction in this matter; therefore I beſeech you that are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Preachers, to ſtrive to be wiſe by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all holy Means; for by ſo doing, you may obtain to be ſuch Preachers, of whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Moreover, becauſe the Preacher was wiſe, he ſtill taught the People knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt Branch of this Verſe, concerning what the Preacher was, and his qualification; I come now to the ſecond Branch of the Text, which contains the firſt part of the wiſe Preachers Act or Work, <hi>He ſtill taught the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe words contain either the Preacher's perſiſtency, or going on with his Work: Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, His proficiency, or ripening at, or in his Work; <hi>He ſtill taught the people knowledge:</hi> Not as one that was at a ſtand, or height, but as one that grew and proceeded higher and higher in the meaſures of his Divine Attainments; <hi>He ſtill taught the people</hi> higher <hi>knowledge,</hi> or more profound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; and this the after-words ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt take this word <hi>ſtill,</hi> as it gives forth the Preacher's fixation, duration, and continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at his Work: He did not tire, or wax weary of his Imployment, but he <hi>ſtill</hi> went on teaching the People. Whence,</p>

               </p>
               <p>But a little further to open this, Let me give you ſome Reaſons or Arguments to clear this to be a Truth, That every Preacher ought diligently to perſiſt in Preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, Becauſe if the Preacher's oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity be continued, his diligence and painfulneſs in Preaching ought alſo to be continued; for not only Gifts and Grace are Talents to be faithfully and diligently improved, but Time alſo is a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to be improved, and that as conſcionably and diligently by Preachers, as by any men. That Time and Opportunities are to be husbanded and improved, take Chriſt's own words upon this very occaſion; when his Diſciples would have perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to have deſiſted from Preaching for fear of the Jews; a plauſible Argument to avoid perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but mark Chriſt's Anſwer, <hi>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</hi> John 13.9. Day-time is given us for day-work and walks, not to idle and loyter in. This the Ruler of the Synagogue well underſtood, though miſapplyed, when he ſaid to the people, <hi>There are ſix dayes in the which men ought to work,</hi> Luke 13.14. Therefore, if Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt allow a Preacher life-time, health and opportunity, he ought to trade with that Talent, and improve that Opportunity, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all,</hi> Gal. 6.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, Preachers ſhould ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and perſevere in Preaching and Teaching the People Knowledge, becauſe the people <hi>ſtill</hi> need knowledge: and it is the peoples ignorance that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30532:53"/>calls for Preaching; therefore while the people are ſhort and wanting in knowledge, the wiſe Preacher muſt not beſhort or wanting in Preaching, but <hi>ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> teach the people knowledge. This our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, he eyed in giving of Preaching-miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Church, even the ſupply of the Churches need, that the need of the Church ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, by being ſupplyed, as you find <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. from 11, to 16. where the Apoſtle tells us, That the Lord Jeſus, when he gave <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> he gave then to the Church, and Gifts to them for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints. Note, It was not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and beget Saints, but to perfect the ſtate and grace of ſuch as were through Preaching ſavingly begotten; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. the Apoſtle tells us again, That Preaching-Miniſters are given to lay o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Every wiſe and Goſpel-Preacher, ought to perſevere and go on in teaching of the people; becauſe, that which he hath to Preach or Declare to the People from the Lord, is not ſoon Preached or Declared; therefore he had great need to attend diligently and continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this thing; even <hi>ſtill</hi> to teach the people know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30532:53"/>For as their ignorance is not ſoon removed, ſo is not the whole Truth of God ſoon preached. It will be long, yea, very long, e're the wiſeſt of Preachers can either know or declare the whole Counſel of God to his People. Now the whole Counſel of God is to be declared, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 20.26, 27, 28. The Commands of the Lord are exceeding broad, and the Truths of the Goſpel very many. 'Tis not a little time ſpent in Preaching will ſerve to reveal them; Preachers may begin to Preach as young as <hi>Timothy,</hi> and die as old as <hi>Paul</hi> the Aged, and yet be behind-hand in this Work; and therefore had need doubtleſs to be Preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; yea, to be inſtant in Preaching, that is, without unneceſſary intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</p>
               <p>This is the third Argument why every wiſe Goſpel-Preacher ſhould ſtill teach the People knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. And laſtly, Thoſe whoſe work is to Preach to others, ought not to be idle or negligent in the work of their Callings; ſuch ought not to be idle or negligent, working in their own Callings. But every wiſe Preacher hath this for his Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, to teach the people of God, not only to <hi>remember, to keep holy the Sabbath day; but alſo to remember, that ſix days they labour and do all that they have to do,</hi> Exod. 20. Therefore every wiſe and honeſt Preacher, ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber himſelf; Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, and not do this Work of the Lord deceitfully: but as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Timothy,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>But watch thou in all things, endure affliction, do the work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of thy Miniſtry,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:30532:54"/>2 Tim. 4.5. Wherefore what a ſin and a ſhame is it for a Preacher to ſay to the people; Be not idle or ſlothful in buſineſs, and yet he himſelf be idle in Preaching? Such had need to read and conſider that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. from 17 to 24. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, Every wiſe Preacher ought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and continually to Preach, as did the Preacher mentioned in the Text; <hi>He ſtill taught the People knowledge.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Application;</hi> Now by way of Application; This ſerves for a full word of Reproof to all idle, lazy, negligent Preachers of the Word of God, by whatever Name or Title dignified or diſtinguiſhed, who-ever they are, or where-ever they be, let this Doctrine reprove them; for if every wiſe Preacher ought <hi>ſtill</hi> to teach the people knowledge, and to perſevere and perſiſt in the Work of Preaching; this looks wiſhly, and reproves loudly, all ſuch Preachers or Idlers, that ſtand in the place or room of Preachers, and Preach not diligently, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and continually.

               </p>
               <p>How many ſuch Foxes or Prophets are there in <hi>England</hi> at this day, which have not gone up as they ought to do in the Gaps, to ſtop God's Wrath from breaking forth upon poor ſinners, or to help ſinful Souls to know how to ſtand guiltleſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the day of the Lord's fierce anger? Have we not too many Preachers, that account Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a by-work; and accordingly Preach ſeldom,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30532:54"/>even when they pleaſe, as well as how they pleaſe? If ſo they be but Preachers, and Preach at all, though never, or not at all, but when conſtraint, or covetouſneſs conſtrains or induces them, they will, it may be, Preach as much as Law, not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, requireth, or as much as their profit provokes or calls them to, but no more. Theſe are none of the wiſe Preachers in my Text ſpoken of, that <hi>ſtill</hi> teach the people knowledge; no, theſe are ſuch of the fooliſh preachers or prophets, mentioned in the fore-cited <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.3.

               <p>We may ſay of <hi>England</hi> this day, as was ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 7.6. <hi>Their Baker ſleepeth all night;</hi> and the height of this ſin lies in this, That <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Preachers, not onely do not, and cannot Preach, but alſo teach and maintain, That they

Nay, have they not gone higher than moſt ſcandalouſly and unconſcionably to omit, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this bleſſed Work of Preaching, but alſo to make their ſin out of meaſure ſinful, they forbid, and command ſuch as both can Preach and would Preach, that they ſhould not Preach, or ſo much and ſo often Preach as they ought to do? ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Goſpel-preaching and proſperity, may read their doom and name, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>But, wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hyppocrites, for ye ſhut up the Kingdom of Heaven againſt men; for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entering to go in.</hi> Oh think of this ye Preaching-men that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>laſt.</hi> Let me tell you, non-Preaching Preachers, as your ſin is out of meaſure ſinful, ſo will one day your condition be out of meaſure woful; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me, and wo unto me if I Preach not the Goſpel.</hi> Not to Preach, when engaged, called, and enabled to Preach, will make wo enough for ſuch Preachers as feed not the Flock, but themſelves, as you have it <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.28. <hi>Son of man, propheſie againſt the Shepherds of Iſrael; propheſie, and ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord unto the Shepherds; Wo be unto the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of Iſrael, that do feed them; ſhould not the Shepherd feed the Flock?</hi> But now, idle, non-Preaching Preachers or Shepherds, hear your doom at large; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I am againſt the Shepherds, and I will require my Flock

               <head>The ſecond <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>Secondly, This may be for Exhortation to all ſuch as are wiſe Preachers, and are called to the Work of Preaching. Be exhorted <hi>ſtill,</hi> teach the people knowledge, go on to your and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and do not begin a good Work in the World, and in the hearts of the Children of God, and then leave it unwatched over, or unwatered, but <hi>ſtill</hi> be teaching the people knowledge. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this is made a note of folly in the Oſtrich, <hi>That ſhe leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, in the duſt, and forgetteth that the foot may cruſh them, or that the wild Beaſts may break them. She is hardned againſt her young ones, as though they were not hers. Her labour is in vain, without fear, becauſe God hath deprived her of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, neither hath he imparted to her underſtanding,</hi> Job 39.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Oh! you that Preach the Goſpel-Wiſdom, and either are, or would be, counted wiſe Preachers, be exhorted not to be like the Oſtrich; leave not your Eggs in the Duſt, nor to a foot that will cruſh them, but look well to your Seed ſown, and ſecure your Conceptions; and loſe not or endanger your labours, but watch
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30532:56"/>and pray, that you fall not into temptations, but <hi>ſtill</hi> teach the people knowledge. If you decline to teach the people knowledge, the Devil and his Brokers will ſtill teach your people error and folly, as you have it <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.25. <hi>But while men ſlept, his enemy came, and ſowed Tares among the Wheat, and went his way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now will not this grieve a wife Preacher, that ſincerely Preaches for the good of the people, that through his negligence, eaſe, and idleneſs, that not <hi>ſtill</hi> teaching the people knowledge, the people ſhould be all over-grown with Tares and Errors? Therefore my dear Brethren, who labour in the Word and Doctrine, <hi>ſtill</hi> teach your people know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The good Husband-man went to Plow laſt ſeaſon, and will not forbear and loſe this ſeaſon; and the good Merchant-man ventures to Sea his Goods in one Ship and another, to one part of the World, and another in another ſeaſon; ſo ſhould a wiſe Preacher plow up the fallow-Ground this year, &amp; the next ſend out his Commodity to this and the other good Port, in one and another good Ship; take Fraight, ſend thy Winter and thy Summer-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures; remembring <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6. <hi>Oh! he that obſerveth the Wind, ſhall not ſow; and he that obſerveth the Wind, ſhall not reap.</hi> As thou knoweſt not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the Bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child; even ſo thou knoweſt not the Works of God, who maketh all. In the morning ſow thy Seed, and in the evening with-hold not thy hand, for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this or that, or whether they both ſhall be of like good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:30532:57"/>Oh therefore be exhorted, who are wiſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>ſtill</hi> to teach the people knowledge: And to this Work, let me give you a few Motives <hi>ſtill</hi> to teach the people knowledge. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Firſt. It will much argue and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence your love and affection to the Lord Jeſus, that you love his Flock, and feed his Lambs, <hi>John</hi> 21.14. 'Tis the greateſt evidence of love to Chriſt, and to the Lambs of Chriſt, to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and conſtantly teaching and feeding the Flock of God with the Word of Knowledge. And if there be any Preacher that would have, or carry, a black and viſible badge, of neither loving Chriſt, nor Saints, then, and not elſe, forbear to teach the people knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. Secondly, Let this move Preachers, even every wiſe Preacher, <hi>ſtill</hi> to teach the people knowledge; Becauſe, the more you teach others, the more Jeſus Chriſt will teach you. If you would have much of the Teachings of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, be much in the teaching of them that are Chriſt's; <hi>For he that watereth, ſhall be watered; and he that diſperſeth abroad, and giveth to the poor, his Righteouſneſs remaineth for ever,</hi> Prov. 11.25. <hi>with</hi> 2 Cor. 9.9. Now conſider, not only the people need to be Preached unto by you, but you and I have great, even abundant need to have Jeſus Chriſt Preach unto us; therefore <hi>ſtill</hi> teach the people knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 3. Thirdly, <hi>Still</hi> teach the people know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe, 'tis moſt honourable to be moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in this Work; and honour is much taking in theſe dayes, when every one ſeeks the Rulers favour. Now this is the Preacher's way to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30532:57"/>by diligent Preaching; as skill comes by diligence, ſo honour, and deſerved reputation, comes by frequent and painful Preaching. Look how <hi>Solomon</hi> commends the diligent Woman, <hi>Prov. laſt. verſ. laſt.</hi> Even ſo ſhall the diligent Preacher be commended alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. <hi>He that win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Souls is wiſe;</hi> with <hi>chap.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Seeſt thou a man that is diligent in his buſineſs, he ſhall ſtand before Kings, he ſhall not ſtand before mean men.</hi> Therefore though we may not ſeek the honour that cometh of men, yet we may ſeek that which cometh of God, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. Oh! <hi>How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the feet of them that Preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad-tydings of good things,</hi> Rom. 10.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 4. Fourthly, My dear Brethren, it will be very comfortable, in a dying hour, to have Preached diligently in the dayes of Life; And when have we ſo much need of comfort as in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hours? When will ſin, guilt, ſhame, and ſcorn, lie ſo heavy upon us, as in a dying hour? Therefore <hi>ſtill</hi> teach the people knowledge, that God may ſtill continue your comforts, and cauſe your comforts to abound in dying hours. Thus ſhould a wiſe Preacher ſtrive to Preach, that with <hi>Samuel</hi> he may look a dying hour, with joy, in the face, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.2, 3, 5. So <hi>Paul</hi> comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the day of his departing, becauſe <hi>he had finiſhed his courſe, and made full proof of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.5, 6, 7, 8. therefore <hi>ſtill</hi> teach the people knowledge: Yea, our Lord Jeſus uſeth this as a means to ſupport him under the ſting of Death, by this Conſideration; That he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Work his Father committed him to do,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30532:58"/>in <hi>John</hi> 17.4, 5. where our Lord ſaith, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth; I have finiſhed the Work thou gaveſt me to do: And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thy own ſelf.</hi> O! here is the way for a Preacher to find aſſured comfort in a day of Death, that he hath finiſhed his Work in a day of Life; and <hi>ſtill</hi> taught the people knowledge. O! therefore, ye that are appointed to be Lights to men in a dark World; let not, I beſeech you, your Light be put under a Buſhel, or at beſt, but ſhine in a dark Lanthorn; but receive this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and let me leave it as univerſal advice, for every Preacher that hath ears to hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith, to hear and receive, even <hi>ſtill</hi> to teach the people knowledge, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.7. So much for this fifth Doctrine.</p>
               <p>I ſhould come now to a ſecond particular, offered from this firſt Act of the wiſe Preacher, That <hi>he ſtill taught the people knowledge;</hi> that is, He went forward, and made progreſſion in Preaching; He did not ſtick or remain upon firſt Principles, but roſe higher and higher in his Preaching, he <hi>ſtill</hi> taught the people knowledge; that is, higher meaſures and degrees of knowledge: As he was wiſely diligent, ſo was he wiſely proceeding and going forward, from ſtep to ſtep, in the degrees and meaſures of his Knowledge and Preaching. The Point of Doctrine hence is;</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That wiſe Preachers are proſpering or thriving Preachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are not only diligent and conſtant Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but alſo they are growing Preachers; he <hi>ſtill</hi> taught the people knowledge, that is, more and higher knowledge. This was ſhadowed out in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30532:58"/>the Waters of the Sanctuary, which roſe firſt to the Ancles, then to the Knees, then to the Loyns, afterward to a River that could not be paſſed over: Even ſo do Preaching Qualifications, in a wiſe and painful Preacher; who, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, when in their Childhood, or firſt entrance, may ſpeak like Children, and act like Children; yet when they grow up to be men, they will Speak, Preach, and Act like men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. This is that which is promiſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. where <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>The bleſſedneſs of the man that walketh not in the way of the ungodly, but his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law doth he meditate day and night, he ſhall be like a Tree planted by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Water, that bringeth forth his Fruit in ſeaſon; His leaf ſhall not wither, but whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper.</hi> This is the bleſſing, of not onely the Godly Chriſtian, but eſpecially of the truly wiſe, and Godly Preacher, he ſhall grow and flouriſh. The like promiſe we have in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14, 15. where the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, how it will fare with Righteous and Wiſe Preachers; <hi>They ſhall flouriſh like the Palm-Tree, and grow like the Cedar in</hi> Lebanon: <hi>Thoſe that be plauted in the Houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Court of our God; they ſhall bring forth fruit in old age; they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing; to ſhew that the Lord is upright.</hi> This alſo <hi>Paul</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, in that ſaying of his to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.15. <hi>That thy profiting may appear to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the Point a little confirmed; but becauſe this Truth has in part already been ſpoken to, and will neceſſarily fall under conſideration in another place; I ſhall ſay no more to the proof of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30532:59"/>this, but only make one Uſe from it, and that is for encouragement to all wiſe and painful Preachers.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is of Encouragement.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Know aſſuredly, the Lord will bleſs your Seed, and the fruit of your increaſe.</hi> You may reckon your ſelves Children, that cannot ſpeak in the Name of the Lord; but the Lord hath told you, <hi>He will be with you, and make you as a defenced City, and an Iron Pillar, and a Brazen Wall,</hi> Jer. 1.6, 7. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Oh! be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to be ſound faithful and diligent; for though you may go out to Preach, as <hi>Jacob</hi> went forth from his Fathers Houſe, when he ſaid, <hi>With my ſtaff I paſſed over this</hi> Jordan, <hi>but now I am become two Bands,</hi> Gen. 32.10. Even ſo you faithful Preachers ſhall have a time to ſay to the Glory of Free-Grace, I am become two Bands. The Lord hath promiſed, <hi>That his Spirit ſhall lead you, not only unto Truth, but from Truth to Truth, till you are guided into all Truth,</hi> John 16.13. Therefore be encouraged to perſiſt and go on in Preaching the Word in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for the Lord is with you, and he will uphold your goings in his Paths.

Be not Children in your knowledge, but go on towards perfection, as good Miniſters of

As Preachers grow in knowledge, they ſhould ſeek that the people might grow in knowledge; alſo as waters of knowledge flow into them, ſo ſhould they flow forth unto the people: for as your day is, ſo ſhall your ſtrength be; Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed to be with you alwayes in ſuch work, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. And to conclude, take the Counſel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom, in the Grave, whither thou goeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You labouring Ones in this Work of the Lord, feed on that Promiſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. <hi>For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to cloſe, take that good word 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Therefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the Work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now come to the next particular in the Text, which is the Matter which the Preacher preached; that is, <hi>Knowledge: He ſtill taught the people Knowledge;</hi> it was <hi>knowledge</hi> the Preacher taught. He Preached not to make himſelf known, or his <hi>knowledge</hi> known, but to make the people know; <hi>for he ſtill taught the people knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Queſtion may from hence be asked, and that is, <hi>What Knowledge is?</hi>

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:30532:62"/>Or, ſecondly, <hi>What knowledge this is the wiſe Preacher taught the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſpeak a little to the firſt Query; <hi>What know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is?</hi> It is the oppoſite to ignorance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the enlightning or informing the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, either concerning the Author, or the Nature of things, or the End and Uſe of things. I ſay, <hi>knowledge</hi> is an enriching excellency, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling men to make true judgment concerning things. He that is deſtitute of <hi>knowledge,</hi> knows not how to diſcern things, or to difference one thing from an other. But I ſhall not inlarge here, though I might add there is a double ſort of <hi>knowledge,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and Supernatural; or the <hi>knowledge</hi> of things or objects Divine and Heavenly, or the <hi>knowledge</hi> of things or objects Natural. This Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural <hi>knowledge</hi> conſiſts either in the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God or his Will, or the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our ſelves or others.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, It may be inquired, What this <hi>knowledge</hi> in particular is which the Preacher taught the people, ſpoken of in the Text?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Not humane <hi>knowledge,</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and skill in worldly things; but it is <hi>knowledge</hi> of Divine things, or Heavenly things: More particularly it may be diſtinguiſhed into the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, as in Himſelf, Attributes, and Word. Conſidered ſecondly, It conſiſts in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our Spiritual Eſtates and Duties; And under theſe two Heads, I humbly conceive all that Heavenly <hi>knowledge</hi> which a Preacher ought to give-diligence to teach the people the <hi>knowledge</hi> of may be compriſed.</p>
               <p>Thus having a little removed the ſcruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30532:62"/>
                  <hi>knowledge,</hi> what it is, and what that <hi>knowledge</hi> is Preachers ought to teach the people, we may note this point of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. To wit, <hi>That every wiſe Preacher ought to teach the people the knowledge of Spiritual things; or, that every wiſe Preacher ought to teach the people how they may know ſpiritual things, or be knowing in ſpiritual things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Preacher, the wiſe Preacher in the Text did, and this every wiſe and Goſpel-Preacher ought to do.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>knowledge</hi> which a wiſe Preacher ought to teach and impart to the people, 'tis the knowledge of God, and things appertaining to God: Or, ſecondly, the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our ſelves, and things belonging to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But let me a little clear and prove the point to you, That every wiſe Preacher ought to teach the people Heavenly <hi>knowledge,</hi> or the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, and of themſelves.</p>
               <p>For proof of this, take that paſſage <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.12. where the Lord commands <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to teach the people <hi>knowledge:</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us what <hi>Levi</hi> ſhould and ought to do for God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Even teach</hi> Jacob <hi>God's Judgments, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Law,</hi> Deut. 33.10. This <hi>Samuel</hi> well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. <hi>But I will teach you the good and the right way.</hi> This alſo was <hi>Ezra</hi>'s pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for ſaith the Text, <hi>Ezra had prepared his heart to ſeek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Iſrael Statutes and Judgments.</hi> Oh! here is a good Miniſter indeed, that prepares his heart to teach the people, both by his Life, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will of God; and alſo by teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30532:63"/>them in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the Law of God. This alſo was the good <hi>Levites</hi> practice, in 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.22. <hi>That they taught Iſrael the good knowledge of the Lord.</hi> This is that the Lord by <hi>Malachi</hi> declares he expects at the hands of his Prieſts, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.7. where he ſaith, <hi>The Prieſts Lips ſhould, or ought to keep knowledge;</hi> and they, meaning the people, ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth. But to trouble you with no more Quotations, to prove this clear Truth; that every wiſe Preacher ought ſtill to teach the people <hi>knowledge.</hi> The good knowledge of God, is that which every good Preacher ought to impart to the people; I will therefore only add this one more, where we may hear what the Lord ſaith to ſuch Preachers as do not teach the people <hi>knowledge. Wo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Lawyers, for ye have taken away the Key of Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.52. The Phariſees and Lawyers of that day, had great thoughts of their <hi>knowledge</hi> and abilities; but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>We unto you Lawyers, for ye have taken away, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Key of Knowledge from the people.</hi> Oh Friends, it is woful and unworthy to with-hold <hi>knowledge</hi> from the people, if we have <hi>knowledge</hi> to impart to the people.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I ſhall do, is to demonſtrate, by Argument or Reaſon, that this is Truth, to wit, That every wiſe Preacher ought to teach and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <hi>knowledge</hi> to the people; and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 1. Firſt, Becauſe that is the end, the main end, the very end of their Knowledg. Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts Gifts and Grace to Preachers, yea, makes Preachers upon this account, that they ſhould
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30532:63"/>teach, inſtruct, and inform the people. This the Scripture largely gives an account of, as in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt; till we all come to the unity of the Faith, in the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark, The Preacher hath the Office of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the Gifts of Miniſtry, or Gifts to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with as a Miniſter; all for the people, and that alſo for their Edifying, Unity, Knowledge, and Perfection; therefore they ought to deſign this for their Buſineſs, Not to know for themſelves onely, but principally to make the people knowing and wiſe in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Chriſt. Now if this be the end of Preachers, certainly every thing ſhould anſwer its end, or elſe it is Made, Created and Ordained in vain: But ſurely Preachers were not ordained in vain, but to teach the people <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> they are the peoples eyes, not their own on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they are the peoples Stewards, and therefore what Stewardſhip or Talent ſoever they have, they ought to improve them for the people, who are the final end, next to Chriſt's Glory, of all their Attainments. This alſo we have given us in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <hi>It is required, in Stewards, that a man be found faithful;</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, The Preachers ought to Preach the people into <hi>knowledge,</hi> becauſe this is that the Preachers profeſs to do for the people; And are not Preachers bound to what they pretend and profeſs? that is, to teach the people <hi>knowledge.</hi> Certainly, of all men under Heaven, they are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30532:64"/>moſt bound to do what they profeſs, becauſe they reach other men ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe they profeſs to know above the rate of others; and is it not a ſhame for them to perform leſs than other men?</p>
               <p>And thirdly, They profeſs this to be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to be conſcious of doing it; and is it not then both ſhameful and ſinful unconſcionably to neglect it? Should a Phyſician pretend to help and cure ſuch as come to him in their ſickneſs, and ſhould not regard to inquire into their Diſeaſes, nor regard to conſult their good, or direct their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients what to do? Would we not groundedly ſay, He were both idle and diſhoneſt? Even ſo are all thoſe Preachers that pretend to promote the peoples good and underſtanding in the Myſtery of Chriſt, and do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, This is that the people do, or ought to expect at their hands; Namely, That they ſhould teach them the good <hi>knowledge</hi> of God; and therefore this they ought to deſign, They ſhould teach them the good <hi>knowledge</hi> of God; and they ſhould not only deſign it, but labour aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: What was that which <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Friends came together about, and he ſent to <hi>Peter</hi> for, but this, <hi>That he might make them know what was the mind of God,</hi> Acts 10.33? The people expect not that you ſhould fight for them, or trade and traffick for them, but only that you ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Myſteries of Chriſt, and do all you can to make them know the Truth as it is in Jeſus; and of all men under Heaven, your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are the moſt unconſcionable deceivers and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30532:64"/>cheats, that neglect thus to do, and abuſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by keeping them in ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. And laſtly, Wiſe Preachers are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound thus to do, becauſe made Preachers for this end, and ſuch who have profeſſed, and are expected thus to do; but laſtly, are able thus to do alſo; therefore ought to be found likewiſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, thus doing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.45. I ſay, Every wiſe Preacher is able to teach the people the good <hi>knowledge</hi> of God: I do not ſay, Every Preacher, or every one that is called a Preacher, or ſo calls himſelf, but I ſay, every one that God owns for a Preacher, and is truly a wiſe or ſpiritual Preacher, is able to teach the people, and ought ſo to do; as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with us,</hi> 1 John 1.3.</p>
               <p>Mark, What every wiſe Preacher can, and doth do, even declare the things of God, or the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt to the people; and he can and doth endeavour that the people may be brought into the fellowſhip and enjoyment of their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Thoſe are fooliſh Preachers, Lords over God's Heritage, evil Servants, and Self-ſeekers, that ingroſs <hi>knowledge</hi> for themſelves, and deſign not the peoples <hi>knowledge,</hi> as one main end of all that <hi>knowledge</hi> they enjoy or deſign to be made partakers of.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the clearing of this Doctrine, That it is the duty of every wiſe Goſpel-Preacher, to make the people wiſe and knowing in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt. Now to come to the Application.</p>

               </p>

                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:30532:67"/>But again, You that are wiſe Preachers, Preach the people into the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, as well as into the <hi>knowledge</hi> of themſelves; make them to underſtand the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, as juſt, and as merciful. Oh let ſinners know God is Juſt, Holy, and Righteous, <hi>And will by no means, or not at all clear the guilty, or acquit the wicked,</hi> Nahum. 1.3. Cauſe the deceived Multitude to know the Juſt and Holy Nature of God, that they may not flatter and deceive themſelves, with hopes and thoughts of happineſs in a ſinful ſtate, and wayes of wickedneſs, becauſe God is merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for he is alſo equally written to be Juſt and Holy, and <hi>a God viſiting the iniquity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children, and upon their Childrens Children, unto the third and fourth Generation,</hi> Exod. 34.7. Oh beloved, Cauſe ignorant Souls to know and conſider if God be juſt as well as merciful, that they muſt alſo be righteous and holy, or elſe God's juſtice will not ſpare them, but condemn them to all eternity, unleſs they believe on the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Oh! cauſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to know the Juſtice of God, and how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to walk on in wickedneſs and diſobedience to the Mind of God, and Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, and be happy, by cauſing them to know the ſenſe of that Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>And it come to paſs, when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart; ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt: The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie, ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this Book,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30532:68"/>ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, when you have done this, make them know, that are bitten with fiery Serpents, that God hath provided a ranſom for wounded ſinners; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the brazen Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo lift up the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Preaching of the Goſpel: ſhew all wounded and undone ſinners the way of healing, by the alone Righteouſneſs and Satisfaction of the Lord Jeſus; make them know, when wounded in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and undone in themſelves, that then if they come ſinners, with their ſin and miſery upon them, without any Righteouſneſs, Qualifications, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, or Performances, only as ſinners, with Ropes about their Necks, <hi>weary and heavy laden, he will eaſe them, and they ſhall find reſt to their Souls;</hi> and this without money, or monies worth; without regard to their humiliation, repentance, reformation, and amendment of life. Oh, make them underſtand the free Grace of God to the vileſt of returning ſinners, make them to know the new and unchangeable Covenant of God with his people, even the Covenant of freeſt Grace to pardon, in pardoning all ſinners, paſt, preſent, and to come, and never to alter or change the ſtate and happineſs of ſuch Souls to all eternity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32.</p>
               <p>Oh be exhorted, all you that are and would be accounted wiſe Preachers, thus to Preach to your people, and teach them this good <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, both as juſt to all not in Chriſt, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all in Chriſt, how vile and miſerable ſoever in themſelves; and thus to do, is to teach the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:30532:68"/>people <hi>knowledge</hi> aright. Oh Brethren, you Nurſes of the Children of God, draw out the Breſts of your Conſolation, and give the little ones of Chriſt nouriſhment; nouriſh them with the Word of <hi>knowledge;</hi> and having begotten them to Chriſt, do not ſtarve thoſe you have begotten to Chriſt, as bad Nurſes do many times their Children; but having begun a good work in any, perfect it to the day of Chriſt; be <hi>Epaphraſes, alwayes labouring, that the Saints may alwayes ſtand perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in all the Will of God,</hi> Col. 4.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection;</hi> But ſome may poſſibly ſay to me, <hi>Is it in the Preachers power, how wiſe ſoever, to teach or infuſe knowledge into the people? Is not this the peculiar prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt, to be eyes to the blind, and to give underſtanding to the ſimple? And doth not</hi> Paul <hi>ſay,</hi> He may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, but God muſt give the increaſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>And therefore why do you urge it on the Preacher, as his Work and Duty, to diſtil and infuſe knowledge into the people, as if it were in his power to teach the people to know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer;</hi> To this I Anſwer, Doubtleſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a peradventure, it is in every wiſe Preachers power to do his duty, which is thus to lay out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the utmoſt, that the people may know.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, Every wiſe Preacher, and the moſt of Preachers, though wiſe, might do more at this work than they do.</p>
               <p>But 3ly, Though without Divine concurrence and preſence with them in the Work, their Work will produce little; yet if they work not diligently at this work, very little advantage can be expected: But if they be faithful and painful, they may,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30532:69"/>yea, ſhall do much through him that ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and hath promiſed to be with them in their way. They are in God's way, and in God's way God will be found, as he hath ſaid <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.12. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Wiſe Preachers ſhould ſtill teach the people <hi>knowledge;</hi> for though they know, they without God cannot teach the people <hi>knowledge;</hi> yet God can by them teach his people <hi>knowledge,</hi> even then when they think they can do leaſt for the people.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude the Anſwer of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, Let us that Preach the Goſpel, conſider that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.6. <hi>In the morning ſow thy Seed, and in the evening with-hold not thy hand, for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that, or whether they both ſhall be alike good.</hi> Therefore you who are Spiritually-wiſe Preachers of the Goſpel, be prevailed upon, to make the peoples knowing, your main buſineſs and work in Preaching; like <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Preacher of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whoſe work was to teach all men in or unto all wiſdom, that he might preſent all men perfect in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>Whereunto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I alſo labour, ſtriving, according to his working, which worketh in me mightily,</hi> Col. 1.28, 29. And to conclude this Uſe; <hi>Let as many as be perfect, be thus minded, Phil.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The third Uſe is for Direction.</head>
               <p>The next Uſe or Improvement I ſhall make of this Point, is for Direction to ſuch Preachers as faithfully endeavour thus to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:30532:69"/>Firſt, Would you teach your people <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or make your Hearers knowing in the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of Chriſt; Then let me beſeech you to Preach humbly, for a proud Preacher is not likely to become a profitable Preacher. This was the frame of Spirit <hi>Paul</hi> went forth Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel with, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.19. <hi>Serving the Lord in all humility,</hi> in that Work. A proud Preacher will more ſtrive to Preach out himſelf unto the people, than the ſaving <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A proud Preacher will be too high to ſtoop or condeſcend to the weakneſs of the capacities of the People; as the proud in heart will not receive Commandments, even ſo the proud in heart will not teach Commandments. 'Tis too hard for ſuch to teach <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or for the people by ſuch to be taught <hi>Knowledge:</hi> Such Preachers as deſire to be profitable Preachers unto others, muſt learn of that wonderful Preacher the Lord Jeſus, <hi>to be meek and lowly of heart,</hi> Mat. 11.29. and do as <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Not to mind high things, but to condeſcend to men of low eſtate.</hi> To which I may add what he writes to the Biſhops and Deacons of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteem others better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Look not every one on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others,</hi> Phil. 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Would you Preach profitably, and cauſe the people to get <hi>Knowledge;</hi> then labour to Preach plainly. 'Tis plain Preaching will only prove profitable-Preaching. This <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to mind, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. as the very ſcope of that Chapter, to provoke Preachers to Preach plainly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30532:70"/>within, not above the underſtanding of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Aſſerting, that if a Preacher preach never ſo rarely; yet if he preach above the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people, he ſhall be but as a Barbarian to the people, and not beneficial to them at all. Plainneſs and Pureneſs are the two great excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Preaching; and as ever a Goſpel-Preaches would be found a profitable Preacher, let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a plain Preacher. Though high Strains, hard Notions, and obſcure or hidden Expreſſions may moſt commend amongſt men, yet plainneſs and profitableneſs will moſt commend to God, and be moſt acceptable and advantagious to thoſe that are perfect and prudent. Oh therefore Brethren, all you that Preach the Goſpel, ſo Preach as <hi>Paul</hi> did, as you have it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. as ever you intend to teach your people <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you would diſtil or infuſe your <hi>Knowledge</hi> into the people, do not only Preach to the people, but live out that you Preach before the people; be not only an <hi>Audible</hi> but a <hi>Viſible</hi> word to the people. How ſhall the people learn that from our lips, which they cannot learn from out lives! This made the Scribes and Phariſees, the great Preachers of that day, they could do no good to the people, but as blind Leaders, led the people blindly into the Ditch; was it not from hence, becauſe they ſay and do not? <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.3. with that of <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.18, 22. Oh, as ever you would be profitable Preachers to others, be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Preachers to your ſelves, practiſe what you Preach, if ever you mean to profit others by that you Preach. Nothing more dulls and blunts
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30532:70"/>the edge of Preaching, than not living out the life of Preaching; therefore <hi>let your light ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And eſpecially, Water all your Preaching with Praying, if ever you would reap the fruit of your Preaching. Oh! my beloved Brethren, Would you profit your people much by Preaching, then water your people much by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; let the beſt Seed that can be ſowen, be ſowen into the beſt ground that can be, yet if ſhowers be with-held, a fruitful crop will never be obtained: Even ſo here, the beſt Sermons will be but loſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, unleſs they are watered Sermons. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, water your Sermons by Prayers; do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for a Sermon, but for a bleſſing upon that Sermon; pray not only publickly, but privately for a bleſſing upon your Labours; loſe not your Sermons through ſhortneſs, or wantingneſs in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performances. This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s way to get <hi>Knowledge</hi> to be the bleſſing of the <hi>Epheſians, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> as you may ſee at large in the firſt Chapters of thoſe Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude theſe Directions, Watch and pray that the Enemy ſteal not your Seed, or Chriſt's Seed rather, away out of the minds and underſtandings of the people. If any ſhall ſay, This is no more then we knew before: yet let me, as once <hi>Peter</hi> did, tell you, <hi>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtir you up, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you in remembrance of thoſe things, though you know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.12.</p>

               <head>The fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is a word of Exhortation to the People.</head>
               <p>The fourth Uſe ſhall be a word to the people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying wiſe Preachers, that thus labour among you. Let it be a word of Exhortation to all ſuch to take the Apoſtle's counſel, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you Brethren, to know them that labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and are over you in the Lord, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you; and eſteem them very highly for their work ſake.</hi> Such are truly wiſe Preachers; yea, ſuch are painful Preachers, and therefore ought to be honoured Preachers; ſuch are profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, therefore worthy to be honoured Preachers; Therefore eſteem highly them that are ſuch. I do not mean to provoke you only ſo to honour, or eſteem, as to approve, commend, or encourage ſuch in their Labours; but eſpecially honour theſe, by ſubmitting and ſubjecting your ſelves, yea, your Souls to their Doctrine; by living and acting, according to their teaching, who teach according to the form of found Doctrine contained in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Oh my dear Friends, this is the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eſteem, and encouragement you can poſſibly beſtow upon painful Preachers; thus ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John,</hi> in 3 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>I rejoyced greatly when the Brethren came and teſtified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkedſt in the truth; I have no greater joy, then to hear that my Children walk in truth,</hi> or according to truth. The like ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in that forecited 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30532:71"/>Are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus at his coming? For ye are our Glory and Joy.</hi> But what was the reaſon of this exceeding Joy, you have it declared in the firſt Chapter. <hi>We give thanks to God alwayes for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; remembring, without ceaſing, your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For our Goſpel came not unto you in Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance, as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your ſake; and ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came followers of us and of the Lord, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word in much affliction, with joy in the Holy Ghoſt: So that ye were enſamples to all that believe in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia; <hi>For from you ſounded out the Word of the Lord, not only in</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>but alſo in every place your Faith to Godward is ſpread abroad, ſo that we need not to ſpeak any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Beloved, is the honour, eſteem, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and rejoycing, wiſe and Spiritual Preachers moſt deſire; that you that hear them, ſhould be wiſe, truly wiſe, holy, diligent, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hearers. There is nothing ſo much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, grieves, and diſhonours wiſe Preachers, as to find their Hearers unwiſe, idle, unthankful, unfruitful, and unholy; this grieves them to the heart when they run in vain, and labour in vain, as you have his expreſſion <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. Oh, grieve not the Spirit of God, nor the Spirit of your Preachers, by quenching the Spirit, and deſpiſing Propheſie, as too many do. If it be a ſin to neglect Preaching, and not to teach the people <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as I have largely proved; yea, if it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:30532:72"/>be not only a neglect, but a moſt unconſcionable neglect not to teach the people <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Let me then tell proud, carnal, unbelieving, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, forgetful, diſobedient, unfruitful Hearers, 'tis not only a ſin, but a complicated ſin; yea, it is not infirmity, but moſt unconſcionable dealing with the Lord Jeſus, your painful Preachers, and your own Souls. Therefore look well to it, for God will not bear it, nor hold ſuch ſinners guiltleſs that thus take his Name in vain, and turn his Grace into wantonneſs.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you think ſeriouſly of a Text or two, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16, 17. <hi>And the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſending; becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling-place: But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his Words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy. Therefore he brought upon them the King of the</hi> Caldees, <hi>who ſlew their young men with the Sword in the Houſe of their Sanctuary, and had no compaſſion upon young Man, or Maiden, old Man, or him that ſtooped for Age; he gave them all into his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh, mark how dreadful a ſin it is to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer, or an oppoſer of Preachers! you may read the hainouſneſs of the ſin, in the dreadfulneſs of the judgment.</p>
               <p>Take one place more, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>With all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh mark it, you that do, or might, if the fault
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30532:72"/>be not your own, enjoy good Preachers, and pure Preaching, and will not, may, and care not for it; God will ſend you Preachers ſad, or bad enough, that ſhall only deceive and delude you, and for this very cauſe; <hi>Even becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God will ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned that believed not through the Truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh think ſeriouſly of this, you ſinful, proud, unthankful, forgetful, or unfruitful Hearers: God will not alwayes ſtrive with you, or wait upon you, or continue the Preaching of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you. Therefore provoke not the Lord to jealouſie, by neglecting and perverting of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>But to cloſe this Uſe, let me give you two or three Directions how to anſwer this Uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is this yet true acquaintance with the greatneſs and groſſneſs of ignorance, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of your own ignorance in particular? Pride makes men think they ſee, and deſpiſe the ignorance and ſimplicity of others; but 'tis ignorance and blindneſs that makes poor and proud Souls like their own ignorance. Therefore if you would be found the Friends and Preſervers of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> learn to know your own ignorance in the things of Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, conſider how diſhonourable and truly reproachful it is for a Profeſſor, or a Chriſtian, to be an ignorant perſon; 'tis as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful, as for a Guide to be blind, or a Ruler to be clad in Rags; than which, what is more diſhonourable? A Fool, in Civil or Natural things, is counted a diſhonour to a Family, and a burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30532:73"/>Relation; even ſuch are fooliſh Chriſtians, or perſons ignorant in the Myſteries and <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Now that the moſt, yea, the beſt of Profeſſors are too ignorant, take two Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>For we know but in part, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie but in part;</hi> therefore let none, how wiſe ſoever, think themſelves wiſe enough; but it is theſe thoughts keeps many Hearers from being wiſe; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.8. <hi>How do you ſay we are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with us, and we will come no more unto the,</hi> Chap. 2.31. Therefore, as the cure of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in the firſt place, remember what <hi>Paul</hi> writes for this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>If any man thinks that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi> Again;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take this Direction if you would be a knowing people, be found a doing people, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and humbly doing what you know of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the way to know more and much of Jeſus Chriſt, to be practical Chriſtians; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Then ſhall we know</hi> (that is, we ſhall then know what we knew not before, when or how) <hi>if we follow on to know the Lord;</hi> and in <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his Will, he ſhall know that the Doctrine is of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be diligent about this buſineſs of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> if ever thou wouldeſt know, as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let not a wavering-minded man think he ſhall receive any thing;</hi> even ſo ſay I, Let not the ſlothful, or the idle Chriſtian, think he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or ever attain <hi>Knowledge</hi> with ſuch a frame of Spirit. With what ſloth and idleneſs, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and forgetfulneſs do too many Profeſſors purſue <hi>Knowledge?</hi> Therefore be <hi>not ſlothful in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:30532:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>of this nature, but <hi>be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hold much and cloſe communion with knowing, wiſe, and holy Perſons: This made <hi>Apollos</hi> become more wiſe and knowing, even his communion with <hi>Aquila,</hi> Acts 18. And this <hi>Solomon</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. telling us, That <hi>he that walketh with wiſe men, ſhall be wiſe; but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>laſtly,</hi> If you would become a knowing people in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, be a praying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Prayer muſt relieve both Preacher, and the preached to, in this thing; Oh therefore be much in Prayer. This was <hi>David</hi>'s practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things out of thy Law.</hi> And to cloſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.4. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth none, and it ſhall be given.</hi> Thus much for this Point.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed in the Text, it is added; <hi>Yea, he gave good heed.</hi> This is the next piece of the deſcription of a wiſe Preacher, <hi>he gave good heed.</hi> From hence obſerve;</p>
               <p>Doct. 7. <hi>That he Preached not raſhly, but heedfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis folly to be ſlight or raſh in any buſineſs, but eſpecially in God's Matters, or in the Matters of Preaching; <hi>Yea, he gave good heed;</hi> it is good to Preach heedfully. As Preaching is honourable Work, ſo it is to be honourably performed; as it is weighty and difficult Work, even ſo ought Preachers warily and heedfully to perform and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30532:74"/>purſue it. This we find impoſed upon Elders or Preachers, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Take <hi>heed therefore unto your ſelves;</hi> ſo in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf, and to thy Doctrine.</hi> Preaching-Work ought to be heedfully, yea moſt heedfully performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſtion;</hi> But it may be demanded, <hi>What is that which a Preacher ought thus heedfully to mind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In general I Anſwer, It is his Preaching. This is clear in the Text, by that which is added, — <hi>and ſought out, and ſet in order many Proverbs;</hi> It was the ſetting in order of Parables the Preacher gave good heed unto.</p>
               <p>But more particularly to Anſwer this Query; Firſt, He ought to give good heed to the obſerving what the preſent ſtate and need of the people calls for; for he is by Preaching, to feed the people with food ſeaſonable and convenient for them: I do not ſay, That he is to eye or anſwer the wanton ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the Hearer, but the preſent neceſſity and need of the Hearer. This is laid down <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.45. <hi>Who then is a wiſe and faithful Servant to give them meat in due ſeaſon?</hi> A wiſe Preacher muſt overſee the ſtate of the Flock, in this regard, to know what they are, and what they want at the preſent, that he may by Doctrine give every one, not ſome, but <hi>every one</hi> his meat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Sinners, and unconverted Souls in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, muſt be heedfully provided for; and the Saints and Children of God in the Aſſembly, muſt much leſs be neglected; the minds of the ignorant muſt be enlightned, and the mouth of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary muſt be ſtopped. The Faith of the doubting muſt be ſtrengthened, and the Faith of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30532:74"/>ſecured. The troubled Conſcience muſt be comforted, and the Conſcience of the ſleepy and ſecure awakned. This is now to give good heed how we Preach, thus wiſely to mind and conſider them we Preach to.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For a Preacher to give good heed how he Preachers, is needfully to obſerve or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſent Viſion of the Lord, or what the Spirit of the Lord at preſent layes warm and freſh in upon his heart to deliver as his preſent Meſſage, and ſeaſonable to the people. That Meſſage which is very lawful and ſeaſonable to deliver to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at one time, is neither ſeaſonable nor lawful to deliver at another time. There is a time, and but a time, that is ſeaſonable for any thing; ſo there is a time, and but a time, when ſome Truths are ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Therefore this is that Preachers ſhould heedfully mind, the teaching, moving, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Spirits, this or that way, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord Jeſus; and give up themſelves to the manuduction of that Spirit. Thus did the living Creatures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.12. <hi>And they went every one ſtraight forward; whither the Spirit was to go they went, and they turned not when they went.</hi> This is Preacher's motion, and thus to move, is heedfully to Preach. Thus did <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that good Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.7, 8. <hi>He hearkened diligently with much heed; and he cryed, a Lyon; My Lord, I ſtand continually upon the Watch-tower in the day time, and I am ſet in my Ward whole nights.</hi> But again;</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Heedfully to Preach, is heedfully to obſerve our ſcope and end in Preaching. As in ſome reſpects the end may be ſaid to crown all, even
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30532:75"/>ſo may I ſay of Preaching. If ends be not right and honourable, it will ſpoil all, as the dead Fly doth the Apothecaries precious Oyntment. A Preacher cannot think to do much good by Preaching, that hath low or poor aims or ends in Preaching. The goodneſs of the Work doth not argue the goodneſs of a Man's Aims or Ends in Preaching: But if ever Preachers would do good at Preaching, let them heedfully mind their Ends. When Ends are right, God uſually bleſſeth; but when Ends are naught and low, God uſually blaſts; as you have it <hi>Haggi</hi> 1.6, to 11. compared with <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5, 6. where the Lord renders the reaſon of all the blaſts or diſappointments they met with, was, <hi>Becauſe of the corruptneſs of their ends.</hi> Had not ſinful ſelf lay at the bottom of the ſacrificing, and faſting, and calling upon his Name, they ſhould have had a Bleſſing; but this with-held it from them: Self-endedneſs at Preaching, is heedleſs and fruitleſs Preaching, God will not bleſs, with any great ſucceſs, ſuch Preaching: therefore Preach heedfully or well-minding that your ends be holy, and pure, even the glorifying God, and the profiting the Souls of the people. In diſcharge of Duty, theſe are right Ends, and not to Preach for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, Credit, or much leſs Merchandize. But again;</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Preachers ſhould heedfully; <hi>yea, give good heed</hi> (as in the Text) to the Matter of their Preaching, and not raſhly ſay, the Lord ſaith. They muſt Search the Scripture, as well as Preach the Scripture, remembring <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm. 39. <hi>I ſaid, I will take heed to my wayes that I ſin not with my tongue;</hi> and what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Suffer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30532:75"/>not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin; neither ſay before the Angel it was a ſin,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.6. But this I muſt ſpeak more to on another particular, and therefore ſhall come to the Reaſons of the Point that Preachers had need to <hi>give good heed</hi> to what they Preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, Becauſe if they Preach heedleſly, Chriſt will mind it heedfully. 'Tis dangerous Preaching heedleſly in the ears of heedful Hearers, but eſpecially in the ears of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe eyes are like a flame of fire, and obſerves all our deportments in his Concernments. If he hear us Preach heedleſly, he will ſet this ſin in order before us, though he ſeem to over-look it, and we think he hath forgotten it. Careleſneſs and raſhneſs in the Miniſtry of the Lord's Word, meets with ſwifteſt Obſervation, and ſevereſt Chaſtiſments: Therefore take heed, and be holy, ye that bear the Veſſels of the Lord, remembring the caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Levit, 10. and of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, The reaſon of Preachers heedfulneſs is this, The Obſervance of men. Are the Hearers, Sinners, and the worſt of Hearers? they will and do obſerve the beſt of Preachers, and lie, as it were, in wait to entrap and catch them, or intangle them in their talk or Preaching. Such as can obſerve little of the Marrow of Preaching, or a Sermon, will be able enough to obſerve all the Miſtakes or Errata's of a Sermon: Therefore take away occaſion from them that ſeek it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.12.</p>
               <p>But again, 2ly, Let Preachers preach heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe of Saints; their eyes are upon you, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30532:76"/>their ears open to you, and they are taught of God to know all things, and as Spiritual men judge all things, and have ſenſes exerciſed; and, like theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereans,</hi> will try all things: Therefore, O therefore, Preach with good heed, and Preach on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good things for their Knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Preachers had need Preach heedfully, becauſe that which they Preach is hard and difficult to Preach. Preaching is not eaſie Work, it is hard Work, 'tis curious Work, it needs much warineſs, wiſdom, and circumſpection, to draw Water out of theſe Wells of Salvation, and to fetch Gold out of theſe Mines of Divine Wiſdom; therefore ought they to give good heed to Preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. And laſtly, Preachers ſhould give good heed how they Preach, becauſe of the worth and excellency of what they Preach. Though men care not how they ſcatter their droſs, yet they are very careful what they do with their refined Gold. Though the Husband-man paſſeth not what he doth with his Chaff, yet he is very careful what he doth with his Seed-corn. Even ſo ſhould it be with Preachers, they ſhould be very heedful where they Sow, and how they beſtow their principal Wheat. Oh! Sow not upon the Rocks, nor on the High-way ſide, but on good Ground; and carefully look to your Seed, to Chriſt's Seed; it is too choice to ſuſtain any loſs; Oh therefore, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Preach, that you loſe not your labour, nor your reward.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Reaſons of this Point; now to cloſe this Head with a word or two of <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Application;</hi> Firſt, If Preachers ought to give good heed how they Preach, then this miniſters a word of Reproof to ſuch as are heedleſs Preachers, that think it is an eaſie facile Work to diſpenſe and propagate Truth; ſurely ſuch do not remember the weightineſs of Preaching, ſo they can but Preach pleaſingly to men, profitably to themſelves, and ſecurely in reſpect of others; they think it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, never applying themſelves to over-ſee or conſider the ſtate of the Flock, the various ſtate of their Hearers, the avoiding of their Enemies, the Salvation of Sinners, and the perfecting of the Saints, by an acute, exact, circumſpect, thorough ſearch and enquiry after Goſpel-Truths, that they might Speak and Preach as the Oracles of God. Well, I ſhall not ſtand upon this, only be minding theſe of that ſad word; <hi>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord negligently:</hi> And let theſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers know, what God hath threatned to all ſlight Preachers, by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with holding in; I will pour it out upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abroad, and upon the Aſſembly of young men together; for even the Husband with the Wife ſhall be taken, the Aged with him that is full of dayes; And their Houſes ſhall be turned unto others, with their Fields and Wives together; for I will ſtretch out my hand upon the Inhabitants of the Land, ſaith the Lord: For from the leaſt of them, even unto the greateſt of them, every one of them is given to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; and from the Prophet even unto the Prieſt,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30532:77"/>every one dealeth falſly. They have healed alſo the hurt of the Daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace,</hi> Jer. 6.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Note; And ſo I conclude this Uſe, 'Tis a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and a deſtructive evil, to be a ſleighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Preacher.</p>

               <head>The ſecond <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>Secondly, Let this exhort all wiſe Goſpel-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to remember the Text, and alſo give good heed to the Work of Preaching: 'Tis not only honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but difficult, likewiſe 'tis high, 'tis hard; Oh therefore give good heed to this Work of Preaching. 'Tis not man's Work, or a Work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſo much for men, as for God. 'Tis Soul-Work; as you love Souls, or have a value of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, take heed to your ſelves in this Work, this bleſſed Work of Preaching.

Oh Speak or Preach as <hi>Paul</hi> words it, as you ought to ſpeak, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.20. ſtudy Scripture, ſtudy Men, liſten to the Spirit, follow its Guidance, give your ſelves up to this Work, taking <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Counſel, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.</hi> Oh ſtrive mightily, to be ſpiritually exact, and perfect Preachers. Oh remember, <hi>It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Steward, that he be found faithful,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.2. Therefore let me beſeech you, Men, Brethren, and Fathers, even all you that are Chriſt's Stewards, and Goſpel-Preachers, give good heed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30532:77"/>to this thing, that you may give up your account with joy, and not with grief of heart.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The third Uſe is of Vindication.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, Let this Doctrine vindicate ſuch Preachers as give good heed in Preaching, ſo to Preach, that they may approve themſelves good Work-men, even Work-men that need not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, dividing the Word aright; ſuch as Preach not as pleaſing men, but as pleaſing God, which tryeth the hearts, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>I ſay, This Truth now cleared, will acquit and juſtifie all ſuch ſober, ſerious, exquiſite, faithful, painful, wiſe Preachers, which give <hi>good heed,</hi> and apply themſelves to be Phyſicians of Value, ſuch as endeavour both to ſound their own, and the peoples hearts, and <hi>to ſee that they Preach as the Spirit gives them utterance and guidance,</hi> Acts 2.4. Such Preachers as ſeek not yours, but you, that your Souls may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus. I ſay, Let this juſtifie the exactneſs and diligence of thoſe, that in the dividing of the Word, make it their buſineſs to divide it aright, and to omit, nor loſe nothing of all the Riches of ſuch Scriptures, as the Spirit of the Lord opens to them; but endeavour to make full proof of their Miniſtry, in a miniſtration of the All committed to their truſt, following that Direction of our Lord, <hi>Gather up the Fragments that nothing be loſt,</hi> John 6.12. So theſe painful and laborious Bees move from Flower to Flower, that is, from Text to Text, and from Syllable to Syllable, that they may help you to Honey, that by Line upon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:30532:78"/>Line, and Precept upon Precept, here a little and there a little, ſeek to impart to you the whole Counſel of God; I ſay, Let ſuch Preachers be juſtified, and not taxed, as at this day, by ſome who make uſe of that ſaying, <hi>What need this waſte?</hi> Mat. 26.8. What need this curiouſneſs, this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, ſo much dwelling upon a Text?</p>
               <p>Why, let this ſerve to Anſwer ſuch; Is there not a cauſe, when it is required of a Steward to be ſound faithful? And this is faithful dealing with Jeſus Chriſt and his Word, to let nothing be loſt.</p>
               <p>But again, ſecondly, If your Preachers, wiſe Preachers, do give good heed, and conſider the ſtate of the Flock, and whereof they have need, and do deal home and plainly with your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all faithfulneſs, not ſparing any man, or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering any man, or pleaſing any man, but dealing faithfully with all men, as approving themſelves to God. Why then conſider, I pray you, It is required of Stewards to be faithful, and ſuch are Stewards even of the maniſold Grace of God; and therefore it is required of them that they be faithful. Oh, let this juſtifie all wiſe, holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diligent, painful, faithful Preachers, that ſeek to turn many from their iniquity; that give <hi>good heed,</hi> and all diligence ſo to Preach, that they may declare that they have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſs, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the Truth, <hi>Commending our ſelves to every man's Conſcience in the ſight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for this Uſe and this Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:30532:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>I now come to the next Word and Work of a wiſe Preacher, that is, <hi>He ſought out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the next Work; and to ſearch or ſeek out: A good or a wiſe Preacher, doth not only give out, and not keep in any thing of all that good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Will of the Lord Jeſus made out to his Soul; But further he ſeeks or ſearches out after more of the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imparted to him; in what is in part known by him, or in what as yet of Chriſt is not manifeſt, but hid from him and them, and may be imparted to them: For the choiceſt, or moſt comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Servant, or Preacher of the Lord Jeſus, knows but in part, and propheſies but in part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had need to ſearch, enquire, or hunt after that of the mind of Chriſt yet behind, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known of him, and which may, for ought he knows, be made manifeſt to him.</p>
               <p>Three things I ſuppoſe this Phraſe may import.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To examine and receive things already viewed or known.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To clear and diſcharge what we know, from what-ever Objections or Cavils might be brought againſt what we know, or conceive we know.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To ſeek out, is to endeavour to get either freſh Viſions of God in our Souls, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and exacter inſight into ſuch Viſions of God as already we have received.</p>
               <p>All this ſeems clearly implyed in this Act of the wiſe Preacher, as is moſt clear, by conſidering the next word, <hi>And ſet in order,</hi> or in their due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>many Proverbs.</hi> The Work of the truly, or ſpiritually wiſe Preacher, is to ſearch, or ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;

                  </gap> is known, or ſhould be known, or may be known. This is the Trade of God's Commands, in order to a Preacher's Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. The Doctrine hence may be this; <hi>That the wiſe Preacher's Work, is not an eaſie, but an hard task, to attain the comprehenſion or full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding requiſite to be found in every Miniſter of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His life is a continued act of ſeeking, or enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after fuller diſcoveries of the mind of Chriſt. This is plainly implyed in this phraſe; <hi>he ſought out,</hi> or ſought after, or ſought into the way of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Parables in order.</p>
               <p>To clear up this Point, two things need proving; Firſt, That the Preacher's Task or Duty, is an hard Task or Duty. Secondly, His life is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Act of learning the mind of Chriſt. As he doth not do all at once he hath to do for Chriſt, neither doth he ſearn all at any one ſeaſon he hath to learn from Jeſus Chriſt: He is alwayes doing, and alwayes learning, until he dies. Therefore is the Preacher's Work hard Work. This <hi>Moſes</hi> well underſtood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3d, 4th, and 6th Chapters. This <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo apprehended in his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And this <hi>Paul</hi> concludes concerning his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. But not to heap up teſtimonies for a thing ſo clear; Conſider this, namely what the Preacher's Work is reſembled to:</p>
               <p>Firſt 'Tis called a <hi>Warfare,</hi> or they are reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to valiant Souldiers; and a Souldier's life is a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fe of hazard and hardſhip, even ſo is the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis ſtiled a <hi>Watchm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>'s life,</hi> and to

               <p>Thirdly, He is called a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and that is no eaſie life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They are called <hi>Husband-men,</hi> and <hi>Labourers,</hi> and <hi>Builders;</hi> all which prove Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a hard Work.</p>
               <p>But to make this more clear; conſider, 'tis a Trade or Buſineſs that is alwayes carrying on, I had almoſt ſaid night and day; and therefore ſure it can be no eaſie, but hard Work, becauſe it is perpetual Work. But ſuch is the Preacher's Work, He muſt not onely be alwayes preaching, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes learning, yea, learning while teaching, in looking after the Mind of Chriſt: His Work is never done, alwayes doing, running on more and more after freſh and fuller diſcoveries of the Will of God. 'Tis an every day, yea, night and day ſtudy of the Word and Wayes of God; <hi>he ſought out;</hi> 'tis opened to us in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4.

Or to the good Woman, perceiving that her Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing Commodity is good, therefore her Candle goeth not out by night. From all which may eaſily be gathered, what a hard and difficult, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and painful life and labour, the wiſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's labour and life is.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the proof of the Propoſition. Let me now give you ſome Arguments to evince
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30532:80"/>this, <hi>That Preachers Work is hard labour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual imployment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Firſt, This muſt needs be thus, becauſe of the matter of Preaching, which is the Mind and Will of Chriſt contained in the Scriptures. Now this Word of Scripture, is like deep, yea, very deep waters; 'tis hard to get the golden precious Truths, and Counſels of Chriſt, contained in the bottom or body of Scripture, forth of them. The Word of God is perfect and ſufficient, but not ſo plain and obvious, that without much ſtudy and ſearch, the whole Counſel or Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein will be attained. In the Word lies contained the manifold wiſdom of God; but 'tis hard to find out the ſum and variety thereof without much diligence. This <hi>Solomon</hi> implyeth, when he ſaith, <hi>Counſel in the heart of man is like deep waters; but a man of underſtanding will dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it out,</hi> Prov. 29.5. Now if that Wiſdom or Counſel which is in the heart of wiſe men is like deep waters, and it requires wiſdom and labour too for the drawing it out; Oh, how much more doth it require the wiſeſt Preachers wiſdom and pains to dive into the Counſels of Chriſt, contained and centered in theſe moſt deep Wells of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Waters of the Sanctuary, the Word of God! Yea, doubtleſs our experience witneſſeth to it, and we daily find all Truth is in the Scripture contained; yet can we hardly draw out or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſo much of Truth, as is eſſentially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for our ſelves, and ſuch as we preach to. This <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth, when he ſaith, <hi>Thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is like the great Mountains, and thy Judgments are a great deep,</hi> Pſal. 36.6. Now if the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:30532:80"/>Statutes, Truths, Ordinances of Chriſt, all which the Preacher is to reveal, and declare to the People, be ſuch a great Deep, and ſo hard to fathom; Oh, how hard then is his work that is a wiſe Preacher, he may well be ſearching out and after this Will of God, and conclude, who is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for theſe things? But again;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Secondly, As the matter of their Preaching is high, and hard to attain; even ſo the Work muſt needs be hard in reſpect of themſelves. They are dull and hard of Learning in what they muſt deliver out. Oh! if a Preachers Leſſon be hard, and he as hard to learn any Leſſon; ſure their task muſt needs be a hard task: But that the beſt of Preachers are bad and dull Learners is moſt evident, both by Scripture and plentiful experience; as in that glorious Saint and Preacher <hi>Job.</hi> How much pains did God take with <hi>Job</hi> from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, even till old age, and yet but in God's account a ſmall ſhallow Scholar; notwithſtanding all God's pains in correcting of him, yet ſaith God, <hi>Who is it that darkneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Job 38.2. Yea, God makes <hi>Job</hi> plead guilty to this Indictment, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3, 4 5. with 42. And ſurely ſuch Preachers are not <hi>Jobs,</hi> but proud <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who will, or dare ſay, or think otherwiſe of themſelves. Such dull, bad, learners of the Mind of God, were <hi>Job</hi>'s three Friends, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.7. Yea, ſuch were Chriſt's Diſciples and Apoſtles, thoſe Maſter-Preachers, thoſe Foundation-Layers; <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. <hi>O Fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken.</hi> Oh Beloved! if Preachers have hard and many Leſſons to learn, and are exceeding dull
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30532:81"/>and incapacious of learning; yea, ſuch that have neither head, heart, nor will to learn. O ſure their work is hard, and they need be early and late ſeeking and ſearching out theſe acceptable words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Preaching-Work is hard Work, becauſe of ſuch to whom we preach. 'Tis hard to find out what words they want, and it is not wiſdom to preach ſuch words as are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or at preſent neceſſary. For though every, and any word that is or can be preached, is pure and perfect, yet not at all times, ſeaſonable or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; you know whoſe rule it is, <hi>All things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but all things are not expedient,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.12. Though every Truth not only may, but ought to be preached, yet not at all times, or to all ſorts of Hearers. There is a peculiar or apt time for every purpoſe under the Sun.</p>
               <p>Now the wiſdom of the Preacher is to know how to time his Word or Doctrine to the preſent wants and neceſſities of the people, and this is very hard, and requires ſearching out of the peoples wants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This makes the Preachers Work hard, how wiſe a Preacher ſoever he be, to find out, not only their wants, but alſo how to apply that which is intended for them, to be received or accepted by them; even God's own People are a wayward and indiſpoſed People, or Children, to the receiving of Spiritual Food or Phyſick; and 'tis a great piece of Heavenly skill, and hard to attain. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf writes it as a great piece of Heavenly Craft, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16.</p>
               <p>But, thirdly, grant a Preacher hath wiſely gone theſe ſteps, yet he muſt ſtill be ſeeking out how to preſerve and water the Seed he hath been admitted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30532:81"/>to Sow, that he loſe not the things that he hath wrought; for 'tis the part of a fooliſh Preacher to preach, and preach much, and not regard what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his Labours. 'Tis to be like the fooliſh Oſtrich mentioned <hi>Job</hi> 39.13, 14, 15, 16. Now this Act makes the Preacher's Act hard work to water and watch his Seed ſown, that he loſe not his labour; therefore his work is hard work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. And laſtly, The Preacher's task is very hard, becauſe of that great oppoſition and difficulty, which Preachers and preaching-work muſt and doth meet withal; that work how eaſie ſoever in it ſelf, yet if it cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much oppoſition, is then and thereby become hard work, even thus is preaching become hard work, becauſe with much hardſhip, labour, and difficulty, it muſt be performed: Satan and Sinners, yea, even Saints themſelves, make the Preacher's Work hard, yea, very hard and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome by their oppoſition. Look how the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Jews</hi> withſtood the building of the Temple; even ſo doth Satan hinder the building of the Spiritual Temple, or preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; So <hi>Paul</hi> words it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.18. Thus he made the preaching of the Goſpel decline from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> Acts 8.1. <hi>with</hi> Acts 13.50. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the preaching of the Word muſt not be hindred or declined becauſe of Perſecution, yet is Perſecution a means to make Preachers look about them, and their work to be hard to them.</p>
               <p>And again, The Preacher's task is made very hard by the oppoſition of falſe Teachers, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Truth of the Goſpel; and who, as <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo do they alſo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30532:82"/>reſiſt the Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. Theſe conſtrain the wiſeſt of Preachers to ſeek out how to preach, that ſuch may not gain-ſay the Truth; or at leaſt, that their folly may be made manifeſt to all men of ſober minds; and this is hard work. How hard was <hi>Paul</hi>'s work made to cut off occaſion from them, that ſought occaſion, when he is to preach Juſtification by Faith only, without the Works of the Law? How did the Jewiſh Teachers oppoſe him? <hi>Acts</hi> 21.27, 28, 29, 30. When he teaches the Doctrine of <hi>Free-Grace</hi> for the worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, notwithſtanding the greateſt of ſins, is he not ſlandered as if he taught liberty to ſin? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. If he teach the ceſſation of the Law, as to life, <hi>How is his preaching oppoſed and ſlandred?</hi> 1 Tim. 1.6, 7. So when he preaches down legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as Circumciſion, and Mears, Drinks, Holy-dayes, New-Moons, and Sabbaths: What labour is <hi>Paul</hi> forced to uſe to defend this Doctrine againſt thoſe Philoſophers and Deceivers? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.11, 12, 13. with <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 16, 17. downwards to the cloſe of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Again, when the Apoſtles preach the Kingly Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Church, how are they oppoſed? <hi>Acts</hi> 3. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. Now the ſilencing, anſwering, and preventing the deſigns of Satan, and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſlandering and oppoſing the Truth, makes the Preachers of the Goſpel much labour to ſeek out how to defend and eſtabliſh the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, Preachers work is made laborious, and hard, by the ſubtilty, evaſions, gloſſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, colours, and pretences, which poor ſinners
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30532:82"/>ſtrive to hide themſelves under, and to evade the power of the Word brought againſt them. This makes the Preacher's labour very hard; ſo to Preach, that every Soul may be brought under the power of it, and every mouth may be ſtopped: By the doing of this Work, alſo by preaching among Saints, how much oppoſition do the Preachers of the Goſpel procure by it? as is clear 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. to the end of the Chapter; ſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 and 13 Chapters: By all which it will appear, that the Preacher had need, yea, great need, to ſeek and ſearch out Arguments to ſupport, incourage, and uphold himſelf in the doing of his duty, and to deliver the Goſpel from being perverted and made of no uſe, by the many deſigns and devices of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and Friends.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the clearing of the Point, to wit, That every wiſe Goſpel-preacher's Work is not eaſie, but very hard, to ſeek after the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and comprehenſion of underſtanding requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to be found in every Miniſter of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Now by way of <hi>Application.</hi> Firſt, If it be thus, it informs us and inſtructs us in two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is of Inſtruction.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> How ignorant and miſtaken ſuch mens thoughts and principles are, as report and imagine that Preaching is eaſie work, and the Preacher's Life is an idle Life or Calling. It appears to me, as theſe never had the honour to be called to this Work, ſo theſe little know what Goſpel-preaching
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30532:83"/>is; but like <hi>Peter</hi>'s natural bruit-beaſts, <hi>Speak evil of things and perſons they know not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12. Surely theſe never read, or never conſidered what <hi>Paul</hi> found Preaching to be, that thus ſpeak contemptuouſly and fooliſhly of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Can that be ſlight, eaſie, idle Work, which is Night and Day-Work, which is Soul and Body-Work; that muſt be done faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, wiſely, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon? Sure the ignorance, pride, and unbelief of ſuch is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great. I ſhall ſay no more to ſuch deceived Souls but only this, Conſider what hath been upon this Doctrine offered, and read the Rules and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Paul</hi> gives to <hi>Timothy</hi> about Preaching; and then tell me whether it be an eaſie, much leſs an idle trifling imployment, yea or no?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The ſecond <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is of Inſtruction.</head>
               <p>But ſecondly, If Preaching be ſuch an hard Work, or Task, and Labour, to perform it wiſely and ſpiritually; Then this acquaints us what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and idle ſinful Preachers ſuch are as pretend to Preaching, yet take no pains in the performance of this Work, but trifle and idle in this weighty &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Imployment. Such may do well to bethink themſelves, it is required of Stewards, that they be faithful; and remember what God hath ſaid, <hi>He will not hold ſuch guiltleſs as take his Name in vain.</hi> Let ſuch idle careleſs Shepherds, as pretend to be Goſpel-Preachers, wiſe and honourable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, view that word <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. with <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Wo to the idol Shepherd that leaves the Flock; the Sword ſhall be upon his Arm, and upon his right
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30532:83"/>Eye; his Arm ſhall be clean dryed up, and his right Eye ſhall be utterly darkned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such worthleſs Preachers are like the evil Spies we read of <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.32. which brought up an evil report upon the good Land of Promiſe; ſo theſe bring up an evil report upon the good Word and Ordinance of God, the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by their light, idle, careleſs, carnal, and unprofitable preaching of the Word; becauſe they ſeek not out, nor ſearch after the ſetting of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or Goſpel. Myſteries aright; neither take pains to conſider what the Peoples wants are to ſupply them; nor what the Peoples ignorance or error is, to avoid it, and deliver the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel from their miſtakings, pervertings; or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by Armour on the right hand and on the left, leaving the People under ſuch generalities, as that they can deceive and flatter themſelves, that their condition is good, and the Promiſes belong to them, though they are in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and the Bond of Iniquity; a form of Godlineſs, without the power of it, not making it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to take away the Cloaks and Shifts, Pleas and Excuſes, Pretences and Fig-leaves, under which poor ſinners ſhelter and hide themſelves from the force of their Preaching, and the wrath of God, although they walk on in the ſtubbornneſs of their hearts, and add drunkenneſs to thirſt, and cry, <hi>God will ſpare,</hi> Deut. 29.19.</p>
               <p>I ſay no more to theſe dumb idle Shepherds, or Preachers of our day, that by thus doing, cauſe their, or rather Chriſt's good Commodity, to be evil ſpoken of. But O that they would remember that ſaying of the Lord to their Brethren, the Sons
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30532:84"/>of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.22, 29, 30. I ſay, <hi>Remember, thoſe that honour God ſhall be honoured of him; but they that deſpiſe him, ſhall be lightly eſteemed of him.</hi> And wo to that Preacher that God eſteems lightly of.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more to theſe, who-ever they be, Prelates or Peſants, Doctors or Dunces, Batchelors or Novices in Divinity, for the pure preaching of the Goſpel, who like unwiſe and fooliſh Shepherds and Preachers, lightly or flightly preach; onely hear and conſider that Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wo unto you, O Prieſts, that deſpiſe my Name; and ye ſay, Wherein have we deſpiſed thy Name? Yea, offer polluted Bread upon my Altar, and ye ſay, Wherein have we polluted it? In that ye ſay, The Table of the Lord is contemptible: And if ye offer the blind for Sacrifice, Is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and the ſick, Is it not evil? But curſed be the Deceiver that hath in his Flock a Male, and voweth, and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>

               <p>But again, The next Uſe I ſhall make of this Point, is for <hi>Exhortation,</hi> (in two Branches) and that to two ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as Preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſuch who hear the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The firſt Branch.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let me preſume to ſpeak a few words to all ſuch as fear the Lord, and preach the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus; firſt, Be exhorted ſo to Preach,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30532:84"/>or make manifeſt the Goſpel, as it ought to be preached or made manifeſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> words it, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.3, 4. Oh! as wiſe Preachers, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſeek and ſearch after the mind of Chriſt, contained in the Proverbs, Problems, or Word of Chriſt. Oh! hunt as Hunts-men do for Game; follow it hard, and follow it cloſe, through thick and through thin, through Bryars and through Thorns, as ſuch who are reſolved not to loſe their time, and labour or deſire, if it be poſſible. Even ſo let every wiſe Goſpel-Preacher endeavour to preach the Goſpel, as ſtriving not to loſe his labour; ſo Preaching, that he may reap the Harveſt or Bleſſing of his preaching; and not onely preach, but ſo preach, as every wiſe Preacher ought to preach; not only unto men, or unto mens ears, but unto mens ears, and into mens hearts alſo, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in Soul for the good of their Souls, until Chriſt was formed in them.</p>
               <p>Oh Beloved! ſtudy not only to preach Notions unto the People, ſo much as to preach Motions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the People, that Chriſt may be formed in them. Oh! ſtudy Soul-convincing, and Soul-converting Doctrine, ſtriving and deſigning that all your Hearers may be delivered into the form of that Doctrine, which from Chriſt, by you, is to them delivered. Oh! this will cauſe you, not only to have matter of Peace, but of Joy and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving alſo with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.17. It is eaſier to ſeek out, and find out a Sermon to preach unto the People, than to find out this skill and wiſdom, how to be able to diſtil or preach a Sermon into the People; for if God, that gives us a Door, yea, an
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30532:85"/>open Door of Utterance unto the People, do not alſo graciouſly give us a Door, an open Door of Entrance into the People; alſo our Preaching will be vain and loſt Preaching, as to the People to whom we Preach; no good will be done, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be undone rather by us, for the better the Preacher is, and the more he preaches, and the People not the better, but the worſe; the more dangerous is that peoples caſe and condition, and the greater will be their damnation. <hi>Wo to thee</hi> Capernaum, <hi>which art exalted to Heaven, thou ſhalt be brought down to Hell; For if the mighty Works which have been done in thee, had been done in</hi> Sodom, <hi>it would have remained till this day: But I ſay, It ſhall be more tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom, <hi>in the Day of Judgment, than for thee,</hi> Mat. 11.23.24. Oh therefore, as the High Prieſts of old bare the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Names upon their Breaſts, even ſo let all wiſe Preachers carry their Hearers upon their Hearts, that God would make their labour of love uſeful, and not a ſavour of death unto death, unto any of them.</p>
               <p>But again, Let me perſwade and exhort ſuch as Preach, to ſeek that they may firſt be preached to, and that doubly.</p>
               <p>Get thy Soul, firſt, preached into Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever thou goeſt to preach Chriſt unto any.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Get the mind of Chriſt preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Soul, before thou goeſt about to preach the mind of Chriſt to any Soul; remembring what is written, <hi>How can they preach except they be ſent?</hi> Rom. 10.15. Oh Preachers! ſeek before ever, or whenſoever you go to preach to others, to get Chriſt to preach forth his bleſſed Truth; to the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30532:85"/>which he would that day have preached forth by thee to others: For how can one receive any thing, except it be given him from Above, or from Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.27. Oh ſeek, and ſearch out diligently what Meſſage is moſt meet for the People; and what Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage Chriſt would have thee now hand forth to the People; for 'tis not every Meſſage, but preſent Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, is a meet Meſſage to be delivered to the People: This we have hinted in the Deſcription of the wiſe Scribe, that he <hi>brings forth of his Treaſury things new and old,</hi> things ſutable and neceſſary for preſent concernment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.52. The Peoples preſent need, ſhould be every wiſe Preacher's buſineſs to ſupply, and that in the firſt place. Oh ſearch, as after the Peoples Leſſons, ſo after the Peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting; be not fooliſh Seedſmen as to ſow your Seed, yea, Chriſt's principal immortal Seed of the Word, and never look after it; be not like the World's Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> that only preach, to preach themſelves into the People, and the Peoples Money into their Pockets; and having performed as much of this as Law requires, and will effect their end, they never care what becomes of their preaching. Oh, pray over your preaching, yea, pray after your preaching, that God would bleſs your preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and add the upper, as the nether Springs to your preaching, and not let you run and labour in vain. Search after the profiting of your Hearers, and ſee how the Seed ſown makes increaſe, in <hi>ſome thirty, in ſome ſixty, in ſome an hundred fold,</hi> Mark 4.8.</p>
               <p>But again, Let me once more <hi>exhort</hi> wiſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ſeek out the deep things of God, contained in the Myſteries of the Goſpel, or manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Oh! be not blind Leaders of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30532:86"/>blind World, leſt you and they fall into the Ditch; ſearch and ſtudy the Scriptures, which are able to make the Preacher, or the Man of God, perfect, or throughly furniſhed unto preaching. Knowledge, Goſpel-Knowledge, is deep Waters: Apply your diligence to draw it out of the Wells of Salvation.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, Suffer me to add one word of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> more; Search and ſee there be no root of Gall or Wormwood ſpringing up to trouble you in your Work; I mean, ſee that the mouths of gain-ſayers, and ſuch as oppoſe your preaching, or ſlander your good Converſation, be ſilenc'd, that they which ſpeak evil of you may be aſhamed. The better and more wiſely any Preacher preaches, the more will be his oppoſition, and therefore his wiſdom ſhould be, to take away occaſion from ſuch as ſeek occaſion, that they of the contrary part may be aſhamed. Oh ſeek to preach preventingly, that whoſoever be Hearers, they may not find any occaſion againſt you, ſave onely in the matter of your God. Strive to countermine Satan and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that whilſt you are ſowing precious Seed, will not ſpare to ſow the Tares. Therefore ſtrive ſo to preach, as to leave them no place or advantage for the Tares; yea, ſeek eſpecially ſo to preach, as the Children that come to you for Bread may not meet with Stones, or ſuppoſe you give them Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents for Fiſhes; I mean, Fancies and Errors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wholſome Food or Goſpel-Truths. Oh! preach plainly, preach purely, preach powerfully, preach plentifully, preach wiſely or warily, leſt you offend one of thoſe little Ones, or ſo much as give them any ſhew or appearance of exception o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:30532:86"/>ſtumbling; nay, let them not have ſo much as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge, evaſion, ſhift, or project, to put by the force and ſcope of your preaching, or to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under from obeying the Truth; but let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul be without excuſe in the day of Chriſt; and this is to be a wiſe Preacher, and to ſeek out and ſet in order many Proverbs and Parables.

               <p>But ſecondly, Let me make from hence one word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to ſuch as are Hearers. If the Preachers muſt ſeek, hunt, and ſearch after the mind of Chriſt to deliver it unto you, then do not you leſs, than ſeek, hunt and ſearch after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and underſtanding what you hear. Take Chriſt's Counſel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Take heed therefore how you hear.</hi> Oh! if Preachers muſt be wiſe Preachers, be not you fooliſh or unwiſe Hearers; if they muſt be painful and careful Preachers, be you not ſlothful careleſs Hearers; if they muſt be watchful Preachers, I pray be not you ſleepy Hearers: For if they muſt give a ſevere account how they Preach, think not but you Hearers muſt give a ſtrict account how you hear; for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>God will deal with the Scholar as with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> Iſa. 24.2.</p>
               <p>Oh, my Beloved, did Preachers know truly and ſufficiently the weight, want, and worth of preaching, they would doutbleſs take more heed how they preach; even ſo would you Hearers, did you but conſider the worth, want, and neceſſity of preaching, you would be more attentive, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30532:87"/>thankful, conſtant, fruitful Hearers: As neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, careleſs, idle Preachers little know, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the worth, or the price, or the miſery of Souls which are loſt for want of wiſe and careful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; no more do you idle, ſleepy, forgetful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Hearers, know or conſider the worth or price of your immortal Souls, nor the danger of your eternal condition, if you obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>Oh Beloved! take heed to your ſelves, and to your feet, when you go to Hearing; and if you have any reſpect for the Lord Jeſus, value of the Goſpel, love to your Preachers, or regard or pity to your own Souls, do not thus evilly requite the Lord, your Labourers, yea, your own Souls, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30532:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time, becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> Thus much for this particular.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to the next, which are theſe, <hi>And ſet in order many Proverbs or Parables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words contain another deſcription of the wiſe Preacher's Work, that is, To endeavour to <hi>ſet in order many Proverbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things need a little clearing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What is meant by a Proverb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What it is to ſet Proverbs in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proverbs, I ſuppoſe, either are to be taken lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſtrictly; or, ſecondly, more largely and figuratively. Litterally, by Proverbs, are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any pithy, ſhort, witty, or ſignificant kind of Expreſſion. Thus we have the word uſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.6. <hi>To underſtand a Proverb, and the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the words of the wiſe, and their dark ſayings. Proverbs,</hi> as ſtrictly conſidered, are witty, wiſe, dark, and ſhort Sayings; and if we look upon ſome few of theſe Preachers <hi>Proverbs,</hi> you ſhall find all this in them; as to inſtance <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.17. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. and a multitude beſides. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Preacher's way and wiſdom led him this way thus to declare his wiſdom, and give forth himſelf; yet we muſt take heed of tying all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to this way, or in this ſenſe to ſpeak, or give forth Proverbs; but to ſpeak or ſet forth Proverbs in a more large and general ſignification, that is, wiſe Preachers ſhould give forth wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the people, though not in the way or form of a Proverb ſtrictly conſidered. He ought to make the People, with himſelf, to underſtand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30532:88"/>Order, Senſe, and right uſe of Divine-Things, Knowledge, or the Word of God; and this is that the wiſe Preacher here intends or ſpeaks of; and this indeed is the Preacher's work and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to ſet forth the Proverbs of Scripture in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or to unvail or declare their true Scope, Uſe, and Excellency.</p>

               <head>The ninth Doctrine.</head>
               <p>The obſervation we may hence learn, is, <hi>That every wiſe competent Preacher, ought with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence endeavour to comprehend, and cauſe others to comprehend the Wiſdom, Senſe, and Order of the Scripture.</hi> This is every Goſpel-Preacher's Trade and Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Two Acts or Particulars the Doctrine includes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>With Relation to the Preacher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>With reference to the Preacher's Charge or Flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt; <hi>In reference to himſelf:</hi> He is moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to deſign and endeavour to underſtand and comprehend the Mind and Will of God contained in the Word. This is, To ſet Proverbs, or God's dark Sayings or Truths in order as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>In reference unto the People:</hi> His Duty, ſaith this Doctrine, is to help them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he comprehends of the Proverbs of God, or meaning of the Scripture; for as he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Preacher for himſelf, much leſs preaches to himſelf; no more ought he to know, underſtand, or comprehend the Proverbs or Myſteries of Truth for himſelf only, but for the People as well
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:30532:89"/>as for himſelf. That this is ſo, conſider a few Scriptures, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.7, 8. you ſhall find <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> and <hi>Bani,</hi> and <hi>Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bethai, Hodijah, Maaſeiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Palaiah, and the Levites, cauſed the people to underſtand the Law; and the people ſtood in their places: They read in the Book of the Law of God diſtinctly, and gave the ſenſe, and cauſed them to underſtand the reading.</hi> Here we have a large account of the Work and Deſign of wiſe Preachers, and good Miniſters, it is to ſet Proverbs in order, or to clear and make known the ſenſe of Scripture to the people; and <hi>v.</hi> 13. it is ſaid, That the People rejoyced at this enjoyment.</p>
               <p>But again, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, That <hi>the Wiſdom of the prudent is to underſtand his way, but the folly of fools is deceit,</hi> Prov. 14.8. Whence mark, A wiſe or prudent Perſon, (ſuch every Goſpel-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought to be) his work is to underſtand his way; that is, his way of preaching, how to give the true ſenſe of God's Word to his People, that is, ſetting Proverbs in order; the contrary of this was that God complained of in the falſe Prophets, or fooliſh Preachers of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſaying, <hi>His Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb Dogs, they cannot bark; ſleeping, lying down, loving to ſlumber: Yea, they are greedy Dogs, which can never have enough, and they are Shepherds that cannot underſtand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10, 11. Mark it well, They are fooliſh Shepherds, or unwiſe Preachers, that cannot underſtand the Mind of the Lord, and know not how to ſet his Parables and Proverbs in order; the like you have <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Who is the wiſe Man that may underſtand this? and who is he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:30532:89"/>to whom the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken that he may declare it?</hi> Take that of <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. where you have <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe Preacher both doing this Work, and teaching wiſe Preachers alſo to do this work, when he ſaith, <hi>Have I not written unto thee excellent things in counſels and in knowledge, that I might make thee to know the certainty of the words of truth, that thou mighteſt anſwer the words of truth to thoſe that ſend unto thee?</hi> verſ. 20.21. alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.31, 32. <hi>The mouth of the juſt bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth wiſdom, and the lips of the righteous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is acceptable.</hi> Take that alſo of <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely believed among us, even as they delivered them unto us, which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were eye-witneſſes and Miniſters of the Word: It ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of things from the very firſt, to write unto thee in order, moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>that thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things wherein thou haſt been inſtructed.</hi> To name no more, take <hi>Paul's</hi> charge and direction to <hi>Timothy, Till I come, give attendance to Reading, to Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to Doctrine; meditate on theſe things; give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13, 15.

Oh, think frequently of that word, <hi>Behold, I am againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that uſe their tongues, and ſay, The Lord ſaith it,</hi> Jer. 23.31.

               <p>In general, This Verſe gives us account of what the Preacher ſought, even <hi>acceptable words;</hi> and this is the ſecond thing he ſought, as this verſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the former acquaints us.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, In the Verſe we have two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> An account of what the Preacher ſought to find out, even <hi>acceptable words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> The excellency or property of thoſe <hi>acceptable words,</hi> in theſe words, and that which was written, <hi>was upright, even words of truth,</hi> or according to truth; not only upright, but alſo words of truth.</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe; <hi>The Preacher ſought to find out acceptable words.</hi> This is every wiſe Preacher's Work, to ſeek how to find out <hi>acceptable words,</hi> or how to make his words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
               <p>For the improvement of theſe words, one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is neceſſary to be reſolved, to wit, <hi>What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable words are, or ſuch acceptable words are which Preachers ought to ſeek out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer; Firſt, Negatively, Not flattering words, or deceitful words, though ſometimes ſuch words Preachers ſeek out, and the People account them acceptable; as in that paſſage of the falſe Prophets, who knowing the affection of the King to be for War, finds out acceptable, but deceitful words; who ſaid, with one conſent, <hi>Go up, for the Lord ſhall deliver it into the hands of the King,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:30532:92"/>1 Kings 22.6. But you find theſe were neither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right words, nor words of truth, but of deceit and falſhood, as the conſequent declared it; but the words the wiſe Preacher ſought to find out, as acceptable to the People, were upright, <hi>even words of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Affirmatively; I ſay, <hi>Acceptable words,</hi> which wiſe Preachers ſhould or do ſeek to find out, are words meet to be accepted from him that preaches, by them to whom he preaches; and ſo is every word of truth in the general, though ſome words more eſpecially; as <hi>Paul</hi> implies in that expreſſion, <hi>This is a ſaying worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Acceptable words,</hi> imply words which God accepts, and therefore ſhould be acceptable with the People; Though the People do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them, yet they may be accepted of God. Such were <hi>Mieaiah</hi>'s words to the King, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſaw all Iſrael ſcattered upon the Hills, as Sheep that have no Shepherd; and the Lord ſaid, Theſe have no Maſter, let them return every man to his Houſe in peace,</hi> 1 Kings 22.17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Acceptable words,</hi> imply ſometimes ſuch words as are not only words of truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo acceptable to God, but words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with the People, and ſo acceptable in all reſpects. Such were <hi>Philip</hi>'s words to the Eunuch, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt,</hi> Acts 8.37. The former of theſe cannot be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an acceptable word, the latter may, and yet the words be acceptable; as in that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when he told the King of <hi>Judah, Behold,</hi> Pharaohs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30532:93"/>
                  <hi>Army which is come forth to help you, ſhall return to</hi> Egypt <hi>into their own Land, and the</hi> Caldeans <hi>ſhall come again, and fight againſt this City, and take it, and burn it with fire,</hi> Jer. 37.7, 8. But though theſe words were acceptable, or truth in themſelves, and ſo to the Lord, and ſhould have been ſo to them, as being profitable to them: Yet for all this they were unacceptable to them, as is manifeſt <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Wherefore the Princes were wroth with</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>and ſmote him, and put him in Priſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for the Anſwer of this great Queſtion: <hi>What acceptable words are?</hi> Let me now raiſe this Obſervation or Concluſion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The tenth Doctrine.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the wiſdom and work of wiſe Preachers, is, and ought to be, to preach acceptable words, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall the briefer paſs through this Doctrine, becauſe I have had occaſion already to ſpeak to the main things in it contained. Wherefore for the proof of what hath been aſſerted, to wit, That every wiſe Preacher's wiſdom and work, is to preach <hi>acceptable words,</hi> or acceptably; Conſider, This is <hi>Paul</hi>'s charge, not to <hi>Timothy</hi> only, but in him to all Preachers, to preach <hi>acceptable words,</hi> as you have it in the following words of the Text, <hi>words of Truth: Hold faſt the form of ſound words which thou haſt heard from me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. So to <hi>Titus,</hi> ſpeaking what Preachers or Elders of Churches ſhould be, he ſaith, <hi>They ſhould be men able, by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince gain-ſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Speak thou
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:30532:93"/>the thing which becometh ſound Doctrine;</hi> and once more you have it given in charge among other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, <hi>Sound ſpeech that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be aſhamed, having no evil thing to ſay of you,</hi> verſ. 8. And this <hi>Paul</hi> begs the Prayers of Saints to God for him in this behalf, <hi>That he might not onely Speak, or Preach, but ſo Speak or Preach as he ought to do,</hi> Epheſ. 6.20. with <hi>Col.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>But may not ſome ſay; <hi>How doth it appear all this while, that preaching ſound words, is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceptable words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However I ſhall grant, That to unſound hearts, unſound words are and may be moſt acceptable, as we read where the People ſpake to the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Propheſie not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits,</hi> Iſa. 30.10. Yet ſound Hearts, or gracious Hearers, they count no words acceptably ſpoken, or worthy their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but ſound and wholſome words; as we read of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that they hated the Deeds, or the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> which the Lord alſo hated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>In the opening of this term, <hi>acceptable words,</hi> I told you it implyed <hi>words of truth;</hi> which, and which only, ought of honeſt and wiſe Hearers to be accepted. Therefore to preach ſound words, or words of Truth, is to preach <hi>acceptable words;</hi> being ſuch words which only ſhould be preached, and are alwayes worthy of all mens acceptation. And doubtleſs, this among other things <hi>Paul</hi> alſo intended in that phraſe, <hi>to ſpeak as he ought;</hi> that is, only and alwayes Truth, or the lively O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God; not but that Preachers have other
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:30532:94"/>things to mind, that their words may be <hi>acceptable words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, ſecondly; Seaſonable words are, or ought to be accounted <hi>acceptable words:</hi> Therefore <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking of ſeaſonable words, ſaith, <hi>A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good is it?</hi> or, how acceptable is it? <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.23. Now, a word may be fitly ſaid to be ſeaſonable or ſeaſonably ſpoken, either in reference to God's account, or the peoples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Firſt, In reference to God's, when God's Cauſe and Honour calls for our ſpeaking, then to ſpeak ſuch words as may moſt conduce to the Cauſe and Caſe in hand, is to ſpeak acceptable or ſeaſonable words, ſuch as wiſe Preachers ought to ſeek out, &amp; ſpeak out. Such were <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s words to <hi>Heſter,</hi> when he declared to her the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and charged her, <hi>That ſhe ſhould go in unto the King to make ſupplication to him, and to make requeſt before him for her People,</hi> Chap. 4.8. And when ſhe ſeems to be backward to entertain theſe words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>Mordecai</hi> doubles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeaſonable words, as becomes wiſe Preachers ſo to do, and tells her, <hi>Think not that thou ſhalt eſcape in the Kings Houſe, more than all the Jews: For if thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time, then ſhall their enlargement ariſe from another place, but thou and thy Fathers Houſe ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> verſ. 13, 14. The like ſeaſonable were the words of <hi>Elijah,</hi> both to the King and to the People, when he told the King, <hi>I have not troubled Iſrael, but thou and thy Fathers Houſe, in that ye have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Commandments of the Lord, and ye have followed.</hi> Baalim; <hi>and to the People, when he ſaid, How long halt ye between two Opinions? If the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:30532:94"/>Lord be God, follow him; but if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him,</hi> 1 Kings 18.18, 21. And ſuch were <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when he ſaw them ſo given to Idolatry, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.16, to the cloſe of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>And by the way note, That oft-times God, in a wonderful manner, ſtirs-up the Spirits of his Servants to be ſpeaking ſuch acceptable words as are timous and moſt ſeaſonable, in order to preſent work, as in the inſtances cited, with many more may eaſily appear.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Words may then be counted ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and acceptable, when moſt ſutable to, or ſuiting with the Peoples preſent Caſe, State, and Neceſſities. The work of wiſe Preachers ſhould be, to ſute their words to ſuch occaſions, when a People are ſecure, ſetled in ſin and ſinful wayes; then awakening, quickning, reproving words are moſt ſeaſonable, and to God moſt acceptable when ſpoken, and ſhould be ſo to the People. Such were <hi>John</hi>'s words to the ſinful <hi>Jews,</hi> when he ſaw many of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> come to his Baptiſm, he ſaid unto them, <hi>O generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, who hath warned you to fly from the wrath to come? bring forth therefore fruit meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi> When the Peoples caſe is trouble and ſorrow for ſin, then comforting words are ſeaſonable and acceptable words. This the Lord himſelf teacheth, ſaying, <hi>Speak ye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and cry unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed,</hi> Iſa. 40.1, 2. And in obedience hereunto, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were pricked at their hearts, he ſaid unto them,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:30532:95"/>
                  <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt; for the promiſe is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are after off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Acts 2.38, 39. When the People are ignorant of Truths neceſſary, or in ſome ſenſe of neceſſity to be at preſent known; Now 'tis wiſe Preachers work, to ſeek out ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and acceptable words of information, for the removing the peoples ignorance. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> did in that fore-cited <hi>Acts</hi> 2.14, 15. And thus did thoſe wiſe ones <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> deal with <hi>Apollos,</hi> Acts 18.24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>To name no more Inſtances of this kind, When words may truly be ſeaſonable and acceptable, or both; I ſay, when we ſee the Peoples ſin openly, and dangerous to the inſnaring and indangering of others, then 'tis moſt ſeaſonable to ſtep in with reproving words. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. And with the ſame ſpirit we find him acting againſt <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer, when he ſought to turn away the Deputy from the Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Thus much may ſuffice for the proving and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point; let me now give you two or three Reaſons or Arguments why this muſt needs be a Truth.</p>

                     <hi>Laſtly;</hi> Preachers ought to ſeek out <hi>acceptable words,</hi> becauſe ſuch preaching will only anſwer our engagements and pretentions both to God and Man: Our engagement, who preach, is like our Lord Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>I came from Heaven, not to do my own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me,</hi> John 6.38. And no Preacher is ſo fooliſh or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Preacher, as to pretend leſs than thus to do; wherefore let as many as preach be ſo wiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to do what they pretend to do, and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not to preach themſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and themſelves Servants for Jeſus ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5.</p>

               <p>The firſt Uſe may be for a word of <hi>Reproof</hi> to as many Preachers that are not ſo wiſe as to make this their work, to ſeek out acceptable ſeaſonable words, even ſound words, or words of truth and uprightneſs. Oh, how many fooliſh, careleſs, and unconſcionable Preachers there are, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Theſe may more aptly be ſtiled fooliſh than wiſe Preachers, who more ſtudy humane than divine Writ; and conſult the mind of men, eſpecially great men, rather than the mind of God; and their own gain and intereſt, more than the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples profit.</p>
               <p>All I ſhall further ſay to theſe is, As their ſin is great againſt God and the Souls of the People; even ſo, without repentance, and more wiſdom, their judgment will be heavy, and their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſlumbers not. Let ſuch think ſeriouſly of that ſaying of <hi>Peter, But theſe, as natural bruit beaſts, made to be taken and deſtroyed, ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not, and ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:30532:96"/>hand in your day, in the preſent day, and give it your word, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did in his day, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.

Oh, my Brethren, be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make it your main buſineſs, next to the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after your own Vines, to look after <hi>acceptable words</hi> for the People.

Oh Beloved, be not knowers but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Word, not deceiving your own Souls: This will bring much honour to Chriſt, and you will then ſo do your work, as to have joy, and not grief, in the great day of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let me exhort you that are Hearers, to ſuffer a word of Exhortation, not onely from me, but from your Preachers alſo, which enjoy wiſe and painful Preachers, that make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſeek out <hi>acceptable words</hi> for you. Oh, eſteem ſuch highly for their work ſake, and their work for Chriſt's ſake. Oh, ſlight not ſuch words as coſt them ſo dear, or ſo much, to find out for your uſe. Oh, ſin not againſt ſuch words as are ſeaſonable, and ſhould be to you acceptable. Suffer your Preachers to deal home and plainly with you; 'tis their duty, and their love to Chriſt and you, make their work eaſie; take their labour of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:30532:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>love kindly, deſpiſe not, pervert not propheſyings of ſuch as ſeek out <hi>acceptable words;</hi> and what-ever they ſpeak is words of Truth, and of uprightneſs. If neceſſity be laid upon them to ſeek out <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words,</hi> do not think you are at liberty, whether you will receive or refuſe them. Nay, think of that dreadful word, <hi>Lo, when this cometh to paſs, then ſhall they know that a Prophet hath been among you,</hi> Ezek. 33.33. The great God that made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain, hath not made wiſe Preachers in vain, or that you ſhould turn a deaf ear, or a rebellious heart towards them. They muſt ſift, hunt, and ſearch out <hi>acceptable words</hi> for you; and you ought to receive them with all readineſs of mind, and take heed that they loſe not through you the things which they have wrought. Oh believe it, your ſpiritual wiſe Preachers do bring you <hi>acceptable words, meat in due ſeaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him that hath ears, hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly; If Preachers muſt ſeek out <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words</hi> for the People, then let their <hi>acceptable words</hi> be acceptably entertained of you: As <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid to the King, ſo let me ſay to all you to whom this Truth ſhall come, <hi>Let my Counſel be acceptable to you, and break off your ſins by Righteouſneſs, and your iniquities by ſhewing of mercy,</hi> Dan. 4.27. I mean, your ſins againſt wiſe Preachers, and their <hi>acceptable words</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus much for this Word and this Point. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now from the Preacher's Work to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Commendation; <hi>And that which was written was upright, even words of Truth.</hi>

                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:30532:98"/>That this frame of Spirit and walking is lovely and excellent, take the witneſs of a ſtranger in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning <hi>David,</hi> when he told him, <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Lord liveth, thou haſt been upright, and thy going out, and thy coming in with me in the Hoſt, is good in my ſight; for I have not found evil in thee, ſince the day of thy coming unto me, to this day,</hi> 1 Sam. 29.6. Take alſo <hi>David</hi>'s own te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, when he ſings forth the excellency of his Spirit, ſaying, <hi>I was alſo upright before him, and have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity,</hi> 2 Sam. 22.24. But ſetting aſide Man's teſtimony to this Truth, take the Lord's own teſtimony concerning <hi>Job; And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Haſt thou conſidered my Servant</hi> Job? <hi>there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man,</hi> Chap. 1.8. The like honourable acknowledgement doth our Lord give of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Behold, an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite indeed, in whom there is no guile,</hi> John 1.47. And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Such as are upright in their way, are the Lord's delight,</hi> or his delightful ones, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.20.</p>
               <p>But this may ſuffice for the proof of the Point, though manifold Texts might have been produced for the further demonſtrating this, had it been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>Let me now give you ſome <hi>Arguments</hi> to clear this Obſervation, <hi>That truth and uprightneſs in the Spirit, renders ſuch Spirits excellent.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt;</hi> Becauſe this is the frame of God's Spirit or Beeing, therefore to be like God in beeing, muſt needs render us excellent in beeing. That God is thus in his Beeing, take that ſaying for it, <hi>Good
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:30532:98"/>and upright is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 25.8. Alſo that of <hi>Iſaiah, Oh, thou moſt upright, doſt weigh the path of the Juſt,</hi> Iſa. 26.7. Now to have our Spirits according to the frame of God's Spirit, is the moſt excellent frame that can be imagined. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly;</hi> This muſt needs be a moſt excellent frame, becauſe the contrary frame of Spirit is the moſt diſhonourable and unlovely frame that can be. 'Tis ſaid of Satan, That <hi>he is transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angel of Light:</hi> This is the emphaſis or height of his iniquity, he is not upright, he is not as he ſeems to be, he is really an Angel of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pretends to be an Angel of Light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. Therefore when our Lord would ſet forth the vileneſs and unworthineſs of the Spirit of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he tells them, <hi>They are of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, and the luſts of your Father you will do,</hi> John 8.44. And no Spirit is ſo diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deteſted of God, as the Spirit of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; <hi>Wo unto Hypocrites,</hi> Math. 23.27. read that place at your leaſure. Therefore to be of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Spirit to Hypocriſie, muſt needs be excellent; that is, to be upright in Spirit. But again;</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly;</hi> 'Tis that frame begun in us here, which will be our frame perfectly in the ſtate of Glory. Now to be in ſuch a frame here, as we ſhall be in glory, muſt needs be a glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent frame. When the Diſciples ſaw Chriſt transfigured, <hi>That his Face did ſhine as the Sun, and his Rayment was white as the Light,</hi> Mat. 17.2. Even ſo, how glorious are ſuch Souls as are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:30532:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>into the Image of Chriſt, even this image of Truth, and uprightneſs of Spirit? Such are the moſt excellent in their Generation. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</p>

               <div n="4" type="argument">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly;</hi> This can be no other than a Truth, which both Heaven and Earth bear witneſs to; but that this is excellent, even truth and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in whom-ſoever it be found, we have heard the teſtimony of Heaven and of the Scripture; and if we enquire of all ſorts of men under the Heavens, they will all ſeal to this Truth, that Men and Women, of honeſt Spirits, are moſt deſirable and excellent Perſons both to dwell with and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing this Doctrine knows no Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries as to the acknowledgment thereof, I ſhall ceaſe any further demonſtration, and come to <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi> wherein I ſhall ſpeak ſome-thing by way of <hi>Information,</hi> ſome-thing of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and then give ſome <hi>Motives.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Uſe of Information.</head>
               <p>The firſt Uſe I ſhall make of this Point, is to preſent you with a word of <hi>Information,</hi> and that is, Whence it comes to paſs that the Preachers and People of the Lord are no more valued and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than they are this day? 'Tis, becauſe they have no more of this excellent Spirit in them, this Spirit of Truth and of Uprightneſs. I do not ſay this is the only reaſon, or that there is no other reaſon, but I ſay it again, amongſt other Reaſons, this is one grand one: They ſay, Profeſſors want Truth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30532:99"/>and Uprightneſs; talk of Heaven, and of Love, and of Bounty and Patience, yet love the World, and purſue the World, and keep the World as much as any; love few but themſelves, and Men of their own Principles, judging all that believe not as they believe, and practiſe as they practiſe. They are as miſerable and impatient, or forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſlight occaſion, as any other men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men are apt to think that all is not true they ſay, and that they ſpeak not as they think, but are deceitful, meer words and ſhews. Oh my dear Friends! I wiſh that this were altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and that there were not too much truth or ground for this complaint.</p>
               <p>But Sirs, take notice how the want of viſibility and activity in this frame of Spirit, cauſeth our good commodity to be evil ſpoken of; therefore let it be our wiſdom and buſineſs, to take away occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from them that ſeek occaſion, and take heed that we open not the mouths of the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> to rejoyce or blaſpheme. Let Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors know what they can, and talk what they will, 'twil ſignifie little, unleſs they walk alſo in this Spirit of Truth and Uprightneſs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>But ſecondly, and eſpecially, Let this be matter of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to us all, even as many as fear the Lord, both Preachers and Hearers, to labour for, and walk in a Spirit of Truth and Uprightneſs. This we have ſeen is a moſt excellent choice frame of Spirit, in the eſteem both of God and Man. Oh therefore, labour to attain ſuch a frame of Spirit;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:30532:100"/>For naturally our Spirits are otherwiſe in the frames of them; for what the Prophet once ſaid, is ſtill truth, <hi>Every one is an hypocrite, and an evil doer, and every mouth ſpeaketh folly or falſhood,</hi> Iſa. 9.17. 'Tis Mortification of earthly Members, and Sanctification of the Spirit, muſt make us Men or Women of this frame of Spirit; for naturally we are born of another temper, and you who know what Mortification is, know it is not eaſie work to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh; but be it what it may be, yet be prevealed upon, in the fear of the Lord, to ſet upon this duty, even to get our Spirits into this frame, even into this good frame; and if it will coſt us the plucking out of our right eyes, or cutting off our right hands, yet ſubſcribe to it.</p>
               <p>And firſt, Let me freely tender this word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to us that are Preachers, and ſhould be wiſe Preachers, ſeeking out <hi>acceptable words;</hi> and that which by us is at any time preached and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the heart of the People, ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>even words of truth.</hi> Let us be a living Word, as well as a ſpeaking Word; let our lips and our lives joyn together, and ſpeak one thing, even Holineſs to <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Oh, let not us reprove ſin in others, and allow or indulge it in our ſelves. What is that but down-right diſſimulation? Oh, let us not commend Patience, and be impatient; and Humility, and be Sons of Pride our ſelves. This is not to walk with the foot of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to the Goſpel; This is not to be a wiſe, but an unwiſe Preacher, if not a proud <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> and a very Hypocrite. Wherefore, if a Preacher, be under ſuch temptations; as to pretend
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:30532:100"/>Chriſt, and preach Self; and to ſeek Chriſt, and ſeek moſtly Self; as to cry down all ſin, and yet live in cry'd down ſins; to commend Grace and Vertue, and yet live ſhort in Grace, and empty of Virtue; placing thy excellency and piety in ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, and ſaying ſo, and in waſhing the out-ſide, neglecting the inſide; make broad the Phylacteries, and enlarging the borders of your Garments, that is, in uſing ſingular or peculiar reſtraints, and modes of Geſture and Veſture, from other ſober and pious Perſons. Oh, know 'tis not marring of our Beards or Locks, and having our Cloaks long, and our Girdles ſtrait, that can or will prove us wiſe Preachers, or men of this excellent Spirit of Uprightneſs and Truth. Oh no! we may be Fools and Hypocrites for all this; and therefore it nearly ſtands us upon to do as that great Preacher and Apoſtle of the Gentiles did; <hi>Even to keep under</hi> (or beat black and blew) <hi>our body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt</hi> (O mark it) <hi>that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. And anſwer all temptations to contrary-mindedneſs or contrary-ſpiritedneſs to this Doctrine and frame of Spirit, as good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, ſaying, <hi>Shall ſuch a man as I flee? Who being as I am, would deſiſt?</hi> Chap. 6.11. So let us. Who that is as I am, a Man, Ah more than a Man, a Chriſtian; yea more than a Chriſtian, a Preacher to Chriſtians, that would ſeek great things for himſelf, under pretence of ſeeking great things for Chriſt? Oh, who that were a Preacher as I, and preached down Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Idleneſs, Earthly-mindedneſs in others, would live in theſe things himſelf? Oh no, my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:30532:101"/>Soul, I will not, I dare not, leſt I be not found a wiſe, but an unwiſe Preacher, and that which by me is written or preached, be not words of Truth and Uprightneſs. And in the Cloſe, what-ever I may be to others, I be to my ſelf a caſt-away. O therefore, let Preachers eſpecially receive and improve this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and ſee that <hi>our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be only as becometh the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 1.27. And to cloſe up this Head of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> Let as many as are and would be found wiſe Preachers, be perſwaded to think often and deeply of that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Therefore, ſeeing we have this Miniſtry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not, but have renounced the hidden things of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty; not walking in craftineſs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, commending our ſelves to every man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus tendred my Mite to Preachers, let me now be your Exhorter that are Hearers; Men and Women fearing the Lord, Oh, let this be your frame of Spirit, be like your Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> of a plain Spirit; who hath his commendation in his youth, that he <hi>was a plain man,</hi> Gen. 25.27. Oh, ſuch let us that fear the Lord be, let our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide be manifeſt by our out-ſide; let our Words and our Works agree; our profeſſions both to God and Man, and our performances agree and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond together; let our Light and our Life agree, our publick and private walking agree; ſo ſhewing forth, that we are <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guile. Even <hi>the Epiſtle of Chriſt, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:30532:101"/>of the heart,</hi> as we have it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. Oh, 'tis living forth this Doctrine, will ſpeak us forth clearly to be Chriſtians, or the Epiſtles of Chriſt, when we have ſuch frames of Spirit as are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeaſoned with Uprightneſs and Truth. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, look to your frame of Spirit; Hypocrites can look to their Words and Speeches. Look you to your Hearts, good Words and good Works Hypocrites have for God; 'tis Saints onely have good Hearts for God. Oh, look well to your Spirits, how the frame ſtands bent, whether for Truth and Uprightneſs, or for Falſhood and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; and forget not that word <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Take heed to your Spirits:</hi> Oh, dreſs your Spirits with Truth and Uprightneſs, for the dreſs of the Soul goes further with God, than all the dreſſes of the Body with men can do; as <hi>Peter</hi> informs us, where he adviſes Women, <hi>Not to let their adorning be outward adorning, but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which in the fight of God is of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. Oh my Brethren, look moſtly after the dreſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning of your Spirits, for God is not only a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but converſeth moſt with the Spirits, and moſt delights in the well ordering and compoſure of the Spirit. Wherefore ſeeing the delight and ſacrifice of God, is a broken and a contrite Spirit; give unto God a plain Spirit of Truth and Uprightneſs, knowing that our God loves Uprightneſs.</p>
               <p>And to quicken us to the acceptance of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, let me give you and my ſelf a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Encouragements to induce us to be of this bleſſed frame of Spirit.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> This is the ready way to have God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his love abundantly to us, when he finds ſuch a frame of Spirit in us, as we have it <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.7. <hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, his Countenance doth behold the upright;</hi> that is, favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, or as one that God loves and reſpects. Oh, with what favorable reſpect did God behold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Abraham,</hi> and upright <hi>Job,</hi> not only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, but alſo to reward them or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them; as we find in that ſtory of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> whereby was manifeſted his uprightneſs, and God acknowledges it <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. And when God ſaw that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch a frame of Spirit, God doth not only give him his <hi>Iſaac</hi> from the dead, but tells him alſo, <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, ſaith the Lord; for becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not with-held thy Son, thine only Son, thine</hi> Iſaac, <hi>that in bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy Seed as the Stars of Heaven, and as the Sand that is upon the Sea-ſhore; and thy Seed ſhall poſſeſs the gate of his enemies,</hi> verſ. 16, 17. And leſt this ſhould not be enough, hear further what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes him in the next Verſe, ſaying, <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed;</hi> and all, becauſe he was upright, and in uprightneſs obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Voyce of God. Oh, ſee what favour God bears to upright Men and Women, as in <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and others, might be largely manifeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Conſider, this is an encouragement, or an heart-ſtrengthening frame of Spirit. Oh, how wonderfully will uprightneſs ſtrengthen unto
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:30532:102"/>Truth; according to that of <hi>Solomon, The Lord is ſtrength to the upright,</hi> Prov. 10.29. How did <hi>Daniel</hi>'s uprightneſs give him humble and holy boldneſs in the day of his trouble? as appears by his expreſſion to the King, <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Daniel <hi>unto the King, Live for ever; my God hath ſent his Angels, and hath ſhut the Lyons mouths that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was found in me, and alſo before thee have I done no hurt,</hi> Dan. 6.21, 22. But on the contrary, How does the want of uprightneſs cauſe heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trembling and weakneſs? as you may ſee in that ſtory of <hi>Haman, Heſt.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. Oh therefore, get and maintain ſuch a frame of Spirit, as will cauſe and maintain in our Souls, a truly well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded confidence and boldneſs to look God and Man in the face withal, without bluſhing in any ſeaſon. But again;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> To move us to make it our buſineſs to get and maintain our Spirits in ſuch a frame; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 'Tis a frame ſo deſirable and lovely, that not only God and all good men love this frame of heart, but all men, even the vileſt of men, approve of this in others, though they may be wanting in it themſelves; and this is the Apoſtles Argument, <hi>Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4.8. But again;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Take this for encouragement towards preſſing after ſuch a frame of Spirit: A deceitful Spirit is a vain Spirit, that goes about to deceive, or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:30532:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>go beyond God or Man, by fraudes, by guiles, and deceits; nay, deceives himſelf; 'tis like cloathing our ſelves with Fig-leaves, or hiding our heads under the Spider's Web; <hi>'tis vain work,</hi> as the Lord tells us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.15, 16, 17. <hi>There is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed, and hid, that ſhall not be known,</hi> Mat. 10.26. <hi>For the folly of fools is deceit,</hi> Prov. 14.8. <hi>For their folly ſhall be made manifeſt to all men,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, and laſtly;</hi> To haſten, conſider but the danger of a contrary frame of Spirit to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and if former <hi>Motives</hi> cannot induce and move us to this frame, yet peradventure this lower <hi>Motive</hi> of ſelf-conveniency and concernment may. Though God is a reſolved enemy againſt all ſorts of ſin and ſinners, yet eſpecially is he reſolved to ſhew himſelf moſt quick and ſevere againſt perſons of this frame. God hath ſaid it, and will make it good; <hi>Bloody and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their dayes,</hi> Pſal. 53.23. Hypocrites, of all men, muſt have their woes, and no portion of woe is ſufficient for their puniſhment ſhort of the Devils, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, which muſt be the portion of Devils, and of Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.41.</p>
               <p>Take but an inſtance or two of this, of two great men in their day; the one a King, and a choice one, but found playing the Hypocrite; the other a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or an Apoſtle, but a bad one, and an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. And behold how ſevere and quick God is in puniſhing both the one and the other. The one is <hi>David,</hi> who playing not only the Murderer and Adulterer, but the unworthy Hypocrite with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> pretending kindneſs, but contriving and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:30532:103"/>effecting his death. How home doth God deal with this good man! now <hi>therefore the Sword ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from thy Houſe:</hi> And if this were too light a puniſhment for ſecret but deteſtible iniquity and hypocriſie, God adds, <hi>Behold, I will raiſe up evil againſt thee out of thine own houſe. I will take thy Wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy Neighbour, and he ſhall lie with thy Wives in the ſight of the Sun;</hi> The ſtory you have at large in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11 <hi>&amp;</hi> 12 <hi>Chapters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the Twelve, that plaid the Hypocrite and Traytor with his Maſter, as you all know; And what became of him? No ſooner is his hypocritical Act performed, but he departed and went and hang'd himſelf. Being a Preacher, could not preſerve himſelf from burſting aſunder, and all his Bowels guſhing forth. Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all Perſons are in moſt danger, if found playing the Hypocrites, as God tells us <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence; thou thoughteſt I were altogethor ſuch a one as thy ſelf; but I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before thine eyes. Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you,</hi> verſ. 22.</p>
               <p>Therefore to cloſe up this Uſe, and this Point; Let it be the care and labour of the Souls of all wiſe Preachers, to ſhare in the Commendation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt by the <hi>Herodians,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth; neither careſt thou for any mar, for thou regardeſt not the perſons of men,</hi> Matth. 22.16.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:30532:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Word of God, take that counſel of <hi>Zechariah, Theſe are the things ye ſhall do; ſpeak ye every man truth to his Neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and love no falſe Oath: for all theſe are things that I hate, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zech. 8.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly finiſhed this Point, and this Verſe, becauſe I am not willing to detain you any longer.</p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed to the next Verſe and Words in the Text, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as Goads, and as Nails faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſemblies, which are given from one Shepherd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the cloſe of this Argument, and of the Text, and is the third Particular aſſerted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all wiſe Preachers in the 9th Verſe; we have his pains and diligence mentioned in the 10th Verſe; we have his Doctrine vindicated; and in this Verſe we have the Original and Advantage of ſuch Preachers and Preaching declared; <hi>The words of the wiſe are as Goads, and as Nails faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſemblies, which are given from one Shepherd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words generally we may obſerve two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> The Nature and Property of wiſe Words, or the words of the Wiſe; <hi>They are as Goads, and as Nails faſtned by Maſters of Aſſembles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> We have preſented to us the Riſe and Original both of ſuch Preachers and Preachings, <hi>they are given from one Shepherd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt we have alſo two Particulars; firſt, The Perſons ſpoken of, only the Wiſe, and the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:30532:104"/>Words, or <hi>the Words of the Wiſe.</hi> Secondly, That where-unto the Wiſe and their Words are reſembled, and that is Goads and Nails.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond general we have alſo two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; Firſt, The Perſon or Spring from whom wiſe Preachers and wiſe Words come; that is, <hi>from the one Shepherd.</hi> Secondly; Note how they come from the one Shepherd voluntarily, freely <hi>they are given from one Shepperd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me briefly open or explicate the Text.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Explication.</head>
               <p>Firſt; <hi>What are thoſe Goads and Nails to which the words of the Wiſe are reſembled?</hi> A Goad ſeems to be that uſual and neceſſary Inſtrument which Neat-herds or Drovers uſe about Oxen, at labour and in travel; ſuch we read of <hi>Judges</hi> 3.31. and in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.21. Nailes are either ſuch as were uſed to faſten Tents, and the Tabernacle with, or other Habitations and things withal. Such was that Nail <hi>Jael</hi> took to kill <hi>Siſera</hi> with, <hi>Judges</hi> 4.21. Maſters of Aſſemblies, or Maſters of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or Maſter-workmen in all Occupations. Some are choicer Workmen than others; one Shepherd, or the great and chief Shepherd is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The drift of theſe words, are only to imply the choiceneſs and uſefulneſs of Wiſe-Preachers and Wiſe-Preaching. They and their Work are as perfect, uſeful, and neceſſary, as the choiceſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and their Works: Such being as neceſſary and uſeful in Spirituals, as any other things can be in Humane Caſes and Concernments.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, From the Compariſon; as <hi>Goads and Nails,</hi> which are not only good and exact in their Nature and Kind, but needful and neceſſary in their Uſe; from which I might note;</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 5.</label>
Laſtly; Note, <hi>All divine Miniſtries and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations come from the Lord Jeſus, that one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, or that original Shepherd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:30532:105"/>For brevity ſake I ſhall only inſiſt upon two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, into which I ſhall draw the ſubſtance of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>That wiſe and ſpiritual Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their words are very uſeful, and neceſſary for the ſpiritual ſervice and benefit of God's People, as the things mentioned, or the choiceſt things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are or can be for natural ends and purpoſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Concluſion is this, <hi>That all Divine Miniſtries and Miniſtrations, ſpring from the alone Will and Wiſdom of the Lord Jeſus, that one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and are freely given for the advantage of his People,</hi> as we have it in the Text, <hi>which are given from one Shepherd, (or from the one Shepherd.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe, to wit, <hi>That wiſe and ſpiritual Preachers and their words are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful, and neceſſary for the ſpiritual ſervice and benefit of God's People, as either the things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, or the choiceſt things in Nature are or can be for natural ends or purpoſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this Concluſion ſhines evidently in Scripture; as in that of <hi>Solomon, A word fitly ſpoken, is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver; As an ear-ring of Gold, and an Ornament of fine Gold, ſo is a wiſe reprover upon an obedient ear;</hi> or, <hi>as the cold of Snow in the time of Harveſt, ſo is a faithful Meſſenger to them that ſend him, for he refreſheth the Soul of his Maſters,</hi> Prov. 25.11, 12, 13. Hear alſo what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> Oh, ſee the great neceſſity
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:30532:106"/>and utility of a wiſe Preacher. But leſt this were not enough, he adds from the Prophet, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad tydings of good things?</hi> Rom. 10.14, 15.</p>
               <p>To trouble you with no more, take that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. where we find the End and Uſe of wiſe Preachers; it is <hi>for perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for edifying of the Body of Chriſt; that we hence-forth be no more Children coſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lie in wait to deceive,</hi> verſ. 12, 14. Two or three things in the Text clear this ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> The Appellation put upon Preachers, (I mean, onely wiſe and profitable Preachers) they are ſtiled <hi>wiſe;</hi> and that is, as honourable to the Preacher, ſo alſo profitable to the People. For as that Peoples loſs is great whoſe Preacher is a Fool; even ſo that Peoples gain is much whoſe Preacher is wiſe, unleſs themſelves be in fault. This our Preacher gives us, ſaying, <hi>The labour of the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wearieth every one of them, becauſe he knoweth not how to go to the City. Woe to thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the morning. Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due ſeaſon, for ſtrength and not for drunkenneſs,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> They are ſtiled <hi>Maſters of Aſſemblies</hi> or Societies, which is a title and place of honour. Now as it is Preachers honour thus to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, ſo it is the Peoples bleſſing and advantage
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:30532:106"/>have ſuch Maſter-Workmen to be their Servants, that can wiſely and profitably ſerve them. That this is Preacher's honour, (who are wiſe to be ſtyled <hi>Maſter-Workmen in God's Iſrael,</hi> take a Text or two: <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth,</hi> Mat. 22.16. with 3 <hi>John</hi> 10. Therefore to have ſuch Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, muſt needs be the Peoples bleſſing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome may Object and ſay, Is it not written, <hi>But the Anointing which ye have received of him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame Anointing teacheth you of all things,</hi> 1 John 2.27?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, firſt, The Scripture no where really contradicts it ſelf any where, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with it ſelf every where, and only ſo ought to be expounded. Therefore this of <hi>John</hi> muſt not contradict thoſe of <hi>Paul</hi> which have been cited; which it would, if this were admitted to be the ſenſe, That ſanctified or anointed Perſons need not the teachings of any man, (no though the wiſeſt of men.) Which what can be more contrary to this; <hi>How ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> But let us take great heed of making Scripture ſo much as ſeem to fight with it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But, ſecondly; to what hath been Objected, I Anſwer, The word <hi>[need not]</hi> may be taken compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, not abſolutely or poſitively; not no need at all, but not that need ye once had, and all have, that have not your anointing; ſuch as are partakers of the Unction of the Holy Ghoſt in a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:30532:107"/>work of converſion, have not afterward ſuch need of any to teach them as once they had, becauſe now under the teachings of that Anointing.</p>
               <p>Nor, thirdly, have they ſuch a degree of need, as ſuch have who are yet without this Unction, and are unregenerate. They moſtly need teaching who are unregenerate, how much ſoever taught with other teaching.</p>
               <p>But, fourthly; Conſult the place, and the ſcope is not to put by the preaching of wiſe, but of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Preachers, as appears <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you, concerning them which ſeduce you.</hi> Now though they had no need of the teachings of ſuch as would ſeduce them, yet it follows not that they had no need of the teachings of ſuch who would not ſeduce them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; Conſider, that though thoſe who lived under the Apoſtles teaching, had not ſuch need of teaching, as ſuch who wanted that teaching, yet that they wanted no teaching doth not follow.</p>
               <p>And, laſtly; Take this for Anſwer, Such as have received the Anointing ſpoken of, though they never enjoy afterwards any humane or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental teaching, yet ſhall be taught by the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, provided it be God's providence, not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence which keeps other means of teaching from them. In extraordinary caſes, God can and will work without means. In ordinary caſes God will work by means, and ties us to attend upon him in the uſe of means; and thus, <hi>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. And ſo much for Anſwer of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:30532:107"/>But now to return to the confirming of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. As their Titles, ſo the Acts aſſigned to them by the Text, and which ought to be performed of them, (or at leaſt deſigned by them) that is, to be as Goads and Nails in the ſenſe given upon the place: They are Leaders, Conductors, or Guides of the Flock of Jeſus Chriſt. And how unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the choiceſt Sheep to lead and conduct themſelves aright in their way or journey? Any Paſtor as well as their proper Paſtor, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Paſtor, if not conducted and guided by wiſe and skilful Leaders or Overſeers. Therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He choſe</hi> David <hi>alſo his Servant, and took him from the Sheep-folds, from following the Ewes great with young, he brought him to feed</hi> Jacob <hi>his People, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Inheritance: So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hands,</hi> Pſal. 78.70, 71, 72.</p>
               <p>But again, Wiſe Preachers are not onely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe Maſter-Workmen, and ſo Skilful, and Guides, and Leaders of the Flock, and ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are reſembled to Goads and Nails: and how neceſſary are they? the uſe of Goads are to excite, and quicken dull and ſlothful Cattel to go forward; and of ſuch uſe is the wiſe Preacher, both towards Sinners and Saints: And thus practiſed Holy <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>This ſecond Epiſtle (beloved) I now write unto you, in both which I ſtir up your pure minds by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; that ye may be mindful of the words which were ſpoken before by the Holy Prophets, and of the Commandments of us the Apoſtles of the Lord and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:30532:108"/>Saviour,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.1, 2. And the need the Church hath of ſuch Workmen, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, ſaying, <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> Iſa. 64.7.</p>
               <p>But, Laſtly; To ſet out the worth and need of wiſe Preachers, and their words, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to Nails; alluding, as I ſuppoſe, to the fixing, ſtabliſhing Nails of the Tabernacle; which how glorious a contrivance and workmanſhip ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in it ſelf, yet would have been of little luſtre, ſmall uſe, and ſhort continuance, if it had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed theſe Stakes, Pins, or Nails, to fix and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it, as in a ſure place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.23, 24, 25. In like manner, O how mutable, unſetled, and like unfixed and wandering Meteors would the World and the People of <hi>God</hi> be, were they without theſe ſure hold-faſts, theſe divine Nails and Pins, as witneſſeth <hi>Moſes,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt your ſelves, and turn aſide from the way which I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you,</hi> Deut. 31.29. Which Propheſy was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Judges</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
               <p>But this may ſuffice to confirm and clear this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That wiſe and Spiritual-Preachers, and their words, are very uſeful and neceſſary for the ſpiritual benefit and ſervice of God's People; as the things mentioned, or the choiceſt things in Nature can be for natural uſe or ſervice. Let me now come to the Application hereof.</p>
            </div>

               <p>The firſt Uſe ſhall be for Information: If wiſe Preachers, and their words, be ſuch choice bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to that People which enjoy them; then how miſtaken are ſuch as think otherwiſe of them, as burthenſome and unprofitable perſons, ſuch as there is little or no need of; and they can live well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without knowing ſo much as others, or that which others can tell them, and have Grace and Light within, and need not ſuch to guide them, and are wiſe enough to know the things of their own concernment, and therefore need not others to teach them. All that I ſhall ſay to theſe is, what the Lord ſaid by <hi>Moſes; O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end,</hi> Deut. 32.29. To which I add, <hi>Wo unto them that are wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own ſight,</hi> Iſa. 5.21.</p>
               <p>And, Laſtly; Let theſe hear the Word of the Lord; <hi>How do you ſay we are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with us. Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the Pen of the Scribes is in vain, the wiſe men are aſhamed, they are diſmayed and taken; Lo, they have rejected the Word of the Lord, and what wiſdom is in them,</hi> Jer. 8.8, 9.</p>

               <p>But, Secondly; This Doctrine affords us a double word of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Firſt, To ſuch as are or ought to be wiſe Preachers.</p>
               <p>Firſt; As Goads, and as Nails, and as Maſters
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:30532:109"/>of Aſſembles: <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good Works,</hi> (as well as hear your good Words). Thus <hi>Paul</hi> did, ſaying, <hi>Be ye followers of us, as we are of Chriſt. For we have given you an Example, that ſo doing you ſhould feed the Flock,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. <hi>and</hi> Acts 20. O, let us that preach to others, preach to our ſelves, to be like what we are reſembled to, even Goads, and Nails, and Maſters of Aſſemblies, (though under that great Shepherd the Lord Jeſus) as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, as not being Lords, but skilful Maſter-workmen, quickning and exciting the Flock to love and good Works. And for this end take we care of two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt; Be ſhining Examples in the practice of what-ever light of Doctrine we hold forth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Practice in our ſelves is beſt preaching unto others.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly; Since we are reſembled to ſuch uſeful neceſſary things, let us, as Leaders of the Flock, both know and take care of the ſtate of the Flock, quickning and provoking ſuch as are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, dull, and wanting, both by encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reprehenſion, as the Peoples caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; imitating Holy <hi>Peter,</hi> who reſolved, ſo long as he was in this Tabernacle, to ſtir the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple up, by putting them in remembrance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.

                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 2.</head>
               <p>But, Secondly; Let me now offer a word of Exhortation to you that are Hearers, which is: If wiſe Preachers ſhould be like goads, and nails, and maſters of Aſſemblies; then let me perſuade you to ſuffer them ſo to be unto you, ſuffer them to overſee your ſtate, and to deal wiſely, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with you, quickning, and exciting you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking, and reproving you, when your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion calls for it, and let them ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you, according to their Duty, as <hi>Joſhua, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Maſter-workmen did, as you may read, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 5. with <hi>Acts</hi> 20. And conſider, although this is the Preachers Duty thus to do, yet is this more than many Hearers and Church-members can bear, either to be obſerved, rebuked, quickened, or fixed in their places, to their work and duty: But are rather like thoſe <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. who ſay, <hi>Let us break their bonds aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and caſt their cords from us;</hi> or like thoſe that ſaid, <hi>Our tongues are our own, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul us?</hi> Pſal. 12. And how then can a Preacher, how wiſe, how diligent, how zealous, how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how loving, how watchful ſoever, do his Duty, to be as goads and as nails, when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot ſubmit to him, but are like thoſe the Lord complains of, ſaying, <hi>Let no man ſtrive, or reprove another; for this people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt,</hi> Hoſ. 4.4. O therefore let me exhort you, that are wiſe Hearers, and enjoy wiſe Preachers, accept of the Counſel given, <hi>Obey
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:30532:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves: For they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you,</hi> Heb. 13.17. But again,</p>
               <p>Laſtly; If wiſe Preachers be ſuch great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſuch uſeful, neceſſary enjoyments (even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of neceſſity to be enjoyed) then all you that enjoy ſuch Bleſſings, bleſs God abundantly for them, and be a bleſſing to them, by accepting them, and their Labours, by obeying, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to them, and their Doctrine. Be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their enlightning words, and quickened by their quickning words, and fixed by their fixing, ſtabliſhing words, and Arguments. <hi>Not being wavering-minded ones, carried about with every wind of Doctrine, or cunning craftineſs of men,</hi> Heb. 13.9. Eph. 4 4. But ſuffer your Preachers to ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; and when the eye ſaw me, it gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me: I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame; I was a Father to the poor, and the Cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out. I brake the Jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the ſpoil out of his teeth,</hi> Job 29.11, 15, 16, 17. and ſo much for this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>One thing more I ſhall ſpeak to, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Text, which is this;</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Fourteenth Doctrine.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all Miniſtries and Miniſtrations spring from the alone will, and wiſdome of the Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>that one Shepherd, and are freely given for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:30532:110"/>of his people;</hi> As we have it in the Text, <hi>Which are given from one Shephard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take for the proof hereof theſe Teſtimonies, <hi>Wiſdome hath builded her houſe, ſhe hath hewed out her ſeven Pillars; ſhe hath killed her beaſts, ſhe hath mingled her wine, ſhe hath alſo furniſhed her Table, ſhe hath ſent forth her Maidens,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 9.1, 2, 3. But again hear what <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made,</hi> John 1.3. and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen,</hi> Rom. 11.36. And again he tells us, God hath ſet ſome in the Church, <hi>firſt</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>ſecondly</hi> Prophets, <hi>thirdly</hi> Teachers, after that are Miracles, then Gifts in Healing, helps in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diverſity in Tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.28. This may ſuffice for the proof of this point, That all Miniſters, Miniſtries, Miniſtrations which are divine and <hi>evangelical,</hi> muſt and do come from the alone good will and wiſdome of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and are freely given for the good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>But for the better opening of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> let me explain theſe few things, (1.) What I mean by Miniſters, Miniſtries, and Miniſtrations. (2.) How they ſpring from the alone good will and wiſdome of the Lord Jeſus. (3.) In what ſenſe I intend they are freely given. (4.) and <hi>laſtly,</hi> why I ſay freely given, for the good of his Church and People.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let me ſpeak to the <hi>firſt;</hi> By <hi>Miniſters,</hi> I mean all, and only all ſuch perſons, as are in the Church of Chriſt, admitted into Miniſtry, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:30532:111"/>Office in the Church; and ſo are diſterenced, and diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Memoral</hi> part thereof, or ſuch who are only <hi>Members</hi> therein: I ſpeak not here of Miniſters, or Officers <hi>Civil,</hi> or belonging to the Commonwealth, nor of <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> or <hi>National</hi> Miniſters; but only of ſuch as are, or pretend to be Chriſt's Miniſters: I ſay all theſe muſt ſpring from him, <hi>Whom God hath made both Lord and Chriſt, and holdeth the ſeven ſtars in his right hand,</hi> Act. 2.36. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.1. By Miniſtries, I mean not Officers but Offices, or thoſe Inſtitutions and Appointments for making of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe alſo ſpring from the Headſhip, Authority, Will, and Wiſdom of the Lord Jeſus only. It is not allowable in any Kingdom, Free-State, or Common-Wealth, that any but the Head and Supream Power thereof, ſhould aſſume the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing or making Offices or Miniſtries therein. Even ſo none ſave the Lord Jeſus is allowed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and appoint what Offices and Miniſtries ſhall be in the Church, that is, in his Church and Kingdom. For although the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all Authority and Power to the Son, to appoint Miniſtries for his Church, yet hath not the Son given or committed any ſuch power, as to inſtitute or appoint any Office or Miniſtry in the Church to any ſort of Perſons under the Sun; but hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make,</hi> Exod. 20. And this was the great ſin of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that <hi>he made Prieſts,</hi> 1 Kings 12.31.</p>
               <p>But, Thirdly; Let me open what I mean or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by a Miniſtration, or by Miniſtrations; to wit, ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Works</hi> as Perſons made Officers over the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:30532:111"/>Church of God are to perform, in, and for the Church of God. Now, I ſay, that as none can appoint Chriſt a Miniſter, or determine by what Miniſtry he ſhall be ſerved but himſelf, no more can or ought any but the Lord from Heaven, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly to appoint what Work or Miniſtration theſe ſhall perform to Chriſt, but <hi>the true Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end of all things,</hi> Rev. 22.13. But as all Miniſtries come from him, even ſo from him muſt proceed all Goſpel-Miniſtration or Performances. But again, when I ſay in the Doctrine, that they ſpring from the alone good Will and Wiſdom of the Lord Jeſus, I intend not to exclude God conſidered as the Father, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever-more; but onely I would exclude all the Children of men from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any part or portion in the begetting or giving beeing to any Goſpel Miniſtry or Miniſtration: This under the Father proceeds from the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who when he aſcended up on high, gave Gifts unto Men for the Work of the Miniſtry, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 'Twas good Will, none could have conſtrained him ſo to have done; and 'twas his own Wiſdom, without the wiſdom of the fleſh, contrived and concluded the mode and manner of his own Service, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. with <hi>Acts the firſt,</hi> abundantly declare. And further, when I ſay Miniſters, Miniſtries, and Miniſtrations are freely given, I intend, that as the Church had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been purchaſed by Chriſt, but that he freely gave himſelf for it; ſo no more had the Church ever attained, or enjoyed, any Miniſtry, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and Appointment about Goſpel-Miniſters, and Goſpel-Miniſtrations, but onely through the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:30532:112"/>good Will and good Pleaſure of him that dwelt in the Buſh, (for indeed all Inſtitutions ſpring onely from the Will and Pleaſure of the Inſtitutor) as not being moral, but inſtituted Beeings. Further, I mean, no man can come to be one of Chriſt's Miniſters, but by the free will of Chriſt. He can neither attain Grace or Gifts to qualifie and fit him, nor choice into any Miniſtry under Chriſt, but by the free-will and good-pleaſure of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth, ſaying, <hi>Whereof I was made a Miniſter, according to the Gift of the Grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power,</hi> Epheſ. 3.7, 8. And as to Choice, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, <hi>The Lot is caſt into the Lap, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16.33. But further, I mean by this Expreſſion <hi>freely</hi> of the Lord, that when ſuch a People attain ſuch a Miniſtry, and ſuch a Miniſter ſuch a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is, or ought to be, of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And, Laſtly; When I tie up all Miniſtries, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, or Miniſters, onely to the Church and People of God, as given and provided for them; I mean, excluſively. They are neither inſtituted nor appointed for the uſe and ſervice of the World, but of the Church and Elect of God; further then accidentally, and by way of redundancy, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. I ſay further, then accidentally: <hi>'Tis Childrens Bread, and ought not to be given to Dogs,</hi> Mat. 15.26. Thus much for Explication.</p>
               <p>Let me now confirm this by <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> to wit, that all Miniſters, Miniſtries, and Miniſtrations, meet to be owned for Chriſt's, or Evangelical, do all ſpring from the alone Will and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:30532:112"/>Authority of the Lord Jeſus, and are freely given for the ſervice of himſelf and People.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt;</hi> This muſt needs be thus, becauſe it is ſaid of Chriſt, That <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name; That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. But this could not be affirmed of Chriſt, if he had not this Priviledge and Prerogative, which Princes on Earth are not denyed, even to give a beeing to his own Miniſters and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. That this Priviledge earthly Powers have aſſumed and been allowed; witneſs <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 41.38, 39, 40, 41. The like we read done by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 2.35. Thus did <hi>Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> Heſter, 10.2, 3. And the like did <hi>Darius,</hi> Dan. 6.1, 2. with many others that might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. And ſhall not the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, be allowed the ſame priviledge which other ſubordinate and inferior Princes are allowed, even to inſtitute, nominate, and appoint his own Servants, or Miniſters, and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations? Yes doubtleſs, for as the Text alledged tells us, <hi>He is exalted to a Name above every Name;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the Lord Chriſt, tells us, This muſt be his priviledge, That <hi>God the Father will make him his firſt born higher than the Kings of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 89.27. Therefore this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative muſt needs be allowed him.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly;</hi> I conclude, this muſt be the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Chriſt, to give the Riſe and Beeing to his own Miniſters, and their Miniſtrations, becauſe none of the Children of men are wiſe enough for ſo great and glorious an undertaking; <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of the accompliſhment of the Work of one of Chriſt's Miniſters, ſaith, and <hi>who is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for theſe things?</hi> Then ſurely, much leſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to inſtitute a Frame &amp; Conſtitution for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Miniſtrations, which requires a greater capacity or ſufficiency then the former; wherefore <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>No man in Heaven, nor in Earth, neither under the Earth, was able to open this Book, neither to look thereon,</hi> Rev. 5.3, 4. Wherefore this concern muſt be let alone to him, to whom of right it doth appertain, even to the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> our Lord Jeſus, for he onely is worthy and capable thereof, as we read <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly;</hi> This muſt needs be the peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Chriſt, to appoint his own Miniſters, and Worſhip, or Service, becauſe 'tis his own; 'tis for himſelf, 'tis for his own Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and who ſhall appoint him Servants, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Servants and Services upon him?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly;</hi> Miniſtries and Miniſtrations Spiritual, Eccleſiaſtical, appertaining to the Kingdom of Chriſt, muſt ſpring from the Free-will and Royal-Pleaſure of the Lord Chriſt; becauſe that as it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:30532:113"/>ſtands not with his Honour, Greatneſs, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs to commit this concern into the hands of Angels or Men, being below true fitneſs or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for the work; ſo neither can any created Power ſnatch Authority, or exerciſe Power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Miniſters and Miniſtrations upon him againſt his Royal Will and Pleaſure; and if they but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do it, let them look to it, for he will one day daſh them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2. And however the Sons of men may attempt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach this Power and Priviledge of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus into their hands; yet let me ſay to theſe as the Prophet in a like caſe did, <hi>What is the Chaff to the Wheat, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jer. 23.28. Even ſo, what is the Will or Power of Man, to the Will and Power of the Lord Jeſus, that he ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, or impoſe upon him? 'Tis truth, Man may impoſe upon the Son of Man; but who can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Son of God? <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were both impoſed upon, and carried whither they would not; but none can impoſe any thing upon Chriſt againſt his will, for he will, and can, refuſe to drink ſuch Gall and Vinegar, however they be that offer it to him. Therefore it remains moſt clear and viſible from all that hath been offered, That this is the alone Glory and Prerogative of the Lord Jeſus, to be the Spring and Fountaneous cauſe of all Miniſtries, Miniſters, and Miniſtrations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his own Church, upon whom he freely beſtowed them.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the confirming and clearing of the Doctrine; I come now to the <hi>Application</hi> of this great Point.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> This ſerves for <hi>Information</hi> in two or three Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It informs us how much ſuch are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that conceive and affirm that it is left free and arbitrary to States and Princes to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what Miniſtry and Miniſtration the People of God ſhould injoy in their Dominions; whereas in truth it nothing at all appertains to them, but only to the Lord Jeſus to appoint and determine what kind of Miniſters and Miniſtrations his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall fall under; as the Arguments before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged do manifeſt. Men have liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to judge and determine for themſelves, but no power to impoſe or determine for others; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who art thou,</hi> O man, <hi>that judgeſt another Man's Servant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth; yea, he ſhall be holden up; for God is able to make him to ſtand,</hi> Rom. 14.4. But again, to proceed;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This informs us how far that aſſertion is from being a Scripture-Truth, which maintains, That Miniſtries and Miniſtrations depend upon the Chriſtian Magiſtrate for confirmation; whereas indeed it depends upon the good will and pleaſure of none of the Sons of Men, but onely upon the Son of God, who is Lord of all things. I ſuppoſe in this caſe, I may ſay with truth, what <hi>Korah</hi> and his Complices ſaid with falſhood, <hi>Ye take too much upon you,</hi> who-ever you are that thus affirm and practiſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This acquaints us, that ſuch Miniſters,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:30532:114"/>and Miniſtries, and Miniſtrations, that ſpring not from the Will, Wiſdom, and Authority of the Lord Jeſus, are none of his Miniſters, Miniſtries, or Miniſtrations, but Man's, either their own or other mens creation or creating; Let them be dignified or diſtinguiſhed by what Names or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſoever, even from the Pope to the Parator: and if ſuch will not be called Antichriſtian Miniſters, yet muſt they ſuffer me to call them <hi>Man's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and let all ſuch Miniſters of Man, and of the Will of Man, hear their doom; <hi>Mine hand ſhall be upon the Prophets that ſee vanity and divine lies; they ſhall not be in the Aſſembly of my People, neither ſhall they be written in the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>neither ſhall they enter into the Land of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord God,</hi> Zech. 13.9. Further this informs us, That all ſuch Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ſpring not from the Lord Jeſus, neither are inſtituted by him, nor found in the Writings of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are none of Chriſt's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but mens ſinful inventions and ſuperſtition, concerning which our Lord long time ſince gave his Judgment, ſaying, <hi>But in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men,</hi> Mat. 15.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, and Laſtly;</hi> This acquaints us, That the Innovation, or bringing into the Church of God ſuch Miniſters and Miniſtrations as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt never inſtituted, neither ſpring from, nor depend upon him, is no ſmall, but a magnified Tranſgreſſion. If it be Treaſon againſt a King for any in his Dominion to introduce Offices, Officers, Laws and Ordinances, without his conſent. O! what high Treaſon is it againſt our Sovereign Lord
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:30532:115"/>King Jeſus, the King, or <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 1.5. I ſay, What Treaſon is it for any man, or number of men, to make and appoint Miniſters and Ordinances in his Church and Kingdom without him! Let all ſuch Traytors againſt the Lord Jeſus think ſeriouſly on two or three Texts of Scripture I ſhall commend unto them; one is that of <hi>Iſaiah, Wherefore the Lord ſaid, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouths, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men: Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work amongſt this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hid,</hi> Chap. 29.13, 14. Again, think on that paſſage of <hi>Ezekiel; And he ſaid to me, Son of man, the place of my Throne, and the place of the ſoles of my feet, I will dwell in the midſt of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>for ever, and my holy Name ſhall the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>no more defile, neither they, nor their Kings in their high places; in their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Threſholds by my Threſholds, and their Poſts by my Poſts, and the Wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy Name by their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations they have committed; wherefore I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them in my anger,</hi> Chap. 43.7, 8. So much for this firſt Uſe, or for <hi>Information.</hi>

This the Lord told <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, Son of man, I ſend thee to the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to a rebellious Nation, that hath rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and their Fathers have tranſgreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me unto this very day; For they are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Children, and ſtiff-hearted; I do ſend thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and thou ſhalt ſpeak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,</hi> Verſ. 2, 3, <hi>with</hi> 5, 7.</p>
               <p>To the Vindication of a Miniſter in his Work, it little matters whether men of what rank or degree ſoever they be, do allow, permit, or diſcourage him, whilſt his Lord and Maſter hath but ſent and commiſſionated him, he need not much be troubled with the prohibitions and oppoſitions of his fellow Servants: Nay, if he will not be rebellious like them, he muſt go on his Errand, and neither fear them, or be prohibited by them, but remember
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:30532:116"/>what is further added in that paſſage of <hi>Ezekiel, But thou, Son of Man, hear what I ſay unto thee; Be not thou rebellious, like that rebellious houſe, open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee,</hi> verſ. 8. And therefore Chriſt's Goſpel-Miniſters may warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly anſwer any that inquire, by what Authority do you thus Adminiſter? <hi>Be it known unto you, that by the alone Name and Authority of the Lord Jeſus, we thus adminiſter; and if any of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Children ſhould be angry with them, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them with their thorney Arguments of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and affliction, they may, as others have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſay, O</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>We are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter,</hi> Dan. 3.16. <hi>with</hi> Acts 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>How ſhall a State or People know who are ſuch Miniſters, and what are ſuch Miniſtrations as are truly Chriſt's, and ariſe from him, miniſter to him, and depend upon him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, By doing that which God enjoyned all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to do, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>And it ſhall be, when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he ſhall write him a Copy of the Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Prieſts, the Levites; And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and theſe Statutes, to do them,</hi> verſ. 18, 19. By thus doing, by Reading, and Learning what God hath written in his Book of the Scriptures may they come to know, who are the true Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Goſpel-Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus. Thus
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:30532:116"/>did that great Reformer <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he would know who were the Lord's true Prieſts and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; He ſearched into the Regiſter, and ſuch of the Prieſts as could not produce and ſhew their Genealogy, he put, as polluted, from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.64, 65.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any profeſs themſelves Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus, and you would know whether they be Chriſt's, or Antichriſt's Miniſters; ask for their Genealogy, and let them ſhew their Line from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> not from <hi>Levi;</hi> I mean, from Chriſt, and not from Men, whether <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Presbyter;</hi> for our Lord took care of this Concern, when he ſpent forty dayes with his Diſciples in ſetling the Things of his Kingdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. <hi>And before he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon High, he gave Gifts unto Men for the Work of the Miniſtry; ſome Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, ſome Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> Epheſ. 4.8, 11. But we read not of any Pope, or Vicar-General; no Cardinals, Arch-Biſhops, Lord-Biſhops, Fryers, Monks, Deans, Doctors, Batchellors, Parſons, Curates, or the reſidue of theſe Locuſts; theſe never came into the World by Chriſt's Charter, or Deed of Gift, made over to the Church before his Aſcention. No, no, theſe came in the back way, through <hi>the opening of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> Rev. 9.1, 2, 3. That wiſdom of the Father, even our Lord Jeſus, who builed his Houſe, killed his Fatlings, alſo provided his own Maidens, or Virgin-Servants, which are but few, yet not too few to do all his Work. As his Houſe ſtands upon ſeven Pillers, even ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided but ſeven ſorts of Miniſters, or Miniſtries, beſides the Widdows, thoſe helps to Government,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:30532:117"/>as the New Teſtament teſtifies: and an Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Iniſtitution, can give no beeing to a New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Miniſtration; and in all the Records of Chriſt's Acts and Inſtitutions, we read not of any other Miniſtry ordained for the Church than the Miniſtry of Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, which three were extraordinary and temporary, and are ceaſed, and there remains only now to be enjoyed the Miniſtry of Paſtor, Teacher, Elder, and Deacon; with the fore-named helps to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as ſufficient to all Ends and Purpoſes in Chriſt's Kingdom; and of theſe we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Having then Gifts, differing according to the Grace given to us, whether Propheſie, let us propheſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of Faith or Miniſtry. Let us wait on our Miniſtry; he that teacheth, on Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he that exhorteth, on Exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity; he that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, with diligence,</hi> Verſ. 6, 7, 8. Now ſuch who have neither Name nor Nature of theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, can be none of Chriſt's, but Man's, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt's.</p>
               <p>But again, ask all ſuch who pretend to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, by what Door or Way they came into the Miniſtry. For they, who ever they be, that come not in by Chriſt's Door into his Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, are Theeves and Robbers, <hi>John</hi> 10.1. Now Chriſt's way for men to become his Miniſters, is by, firſt, joyning and accompanying themſelves with the Church or Congregation, whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they are to be; as appears by <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21. where we read <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Church, <hi>That of theſe men that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:30532:117"/>from the Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>unto the ſame day that he was taken up from among us, muſt one be ordained to be a witneſs with us of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Verſ. 22. And thus they choſe Miniſters, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. according to Apoſtolical Direction, who ſaid, <hi>Wherefore Brethren, look you out from among your ſelves ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghoſt, and Wiſdom, whom we may appoint to this buſineſs,</hi> verſ. 4.</p>
               <p>Again, ask thoſe who profeſs themſelves Chriſt's Miniſters, Who put them into their Miniſtry, the Church, or any particular ſort of men diſtinct from the Congregation, whoſe Miniſters they are? For none but the Church (I mean, a particular Church) can make a Man a Miniſter of any of Chriſt's particular Churches, or Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; It was the Church, not the Apoſtles, choſe, accepted, and admitted thoſe into the Office of Deaconſhip, which we read of <hi>Act.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>And they choſe</hi> Steven, <hi>a man full of Faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and</hi> Philip, <hi>and</hi> Prochorus, <hi>and</hi> Nicanor, and Timon, <hi>and</hi> Parmenos, <hi>and</hi> Nicolas <hi>a Proſelyte of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, <hi>whom they ſet before the Apoſtles.</hi> And if the Churches of Chriſt ſhould not have this power, to give the Beeing and Ordination to their own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Miniſters, without dependance on others, then ſhould the power and priviledges of Chriſt's Churches, be leſs than of civil Corporations, or private Families, which were abſurd to imagine. Not to grant this to every individual and particular Church and Congregation, were to maintain, That Chriſt's Churches are in Bondage, and not Free States, or Politick Bodies, which were derogatory both to Chriſt and to his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:30532:118"/>Further, either the Church, or perſons leſs than the Church, muſt make Miniſters; but the Text tells us, <hi>The leſſer muſt be bleſſed of the greater.</hi> Therefore every Church of Chriſt, and not any diſtinct ſort of Perſons there-from muſt make Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for themſelves. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. we read, <hi>And without all contradiction, the leſs is bleſſed of the greater,</hi> yea, and ſubjected to the greater, even every Goſpel-Miniſter to his Congregation, who may not only, when occaſion requires, <hi>ſay to</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus, <hi>Take heed to the Miniſtry thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, to fulfil it,</hi> Col. 4.17. But likewiſe if <hi>Archippus</hi> will not here reform, and obey them; as they gave him admittance into their Fellowſhip, and into his Miniſtry, they alſo may take from him both the one and the other; and <hi>let him be unto them as an Heathen and a Publican,</hi> Mat. 18.17.</p>
               <p>Again, ask theſe what Miniſters of Chriſt they are? Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and extraordinary Prophets they cannot be, who-ever they be, for they ceaſed with Foundation-work, and Dayes; and as they were raiſed up, and filled with Gifts and Grace, ſuiting ſuch who were to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, Church-Worſhip, Miniſtry and Miniſtrations, according to commiſſion from Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. So they were to be but twelve in number, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. where it is ſaid, <hi>And the Wall of the City had twelve Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb,</hi> Verſ. 14. The laſt Viſion <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and the moſt glorious City that upon Earth the Saints ſhall ever ſee, will have but twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles names in the Foundation thereof; wherefore
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:30532:118"/>try them that ſay they are Apoſtles, and they will be found lyars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. And for Evangeliſts to aſſiſt Apoſtles in writing Scripture, and ſuch like Services, there being now no Apoſtles to aſſiſt, or Scripture to write or fill up, there is no need of theſe, as no way to attain theſe, for all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers came not into the Church by the Door or Way that ordinary Miniſters or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do, but by a more immediate way from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. Paul <hi>an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, not by man, nor of man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> And for extraordinary Prophets, as we have none, ſo all that are acquainted with the Scripture, know they were immediately made Prophets by the Lord: All therefore that ſay they are Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Miniſters, muſt profeſs or acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be either Paſtors, or Teachers, or Elders, or Deacons and Deaconneſſes.</p>
               <p>Now he that is a Paſtor, cannot at the ſame time be a Teacher, that is, an official Teacher, whoſe Work and Office is diſtinct, as well as his name from the Paſtor, and the Elder or Ruler is diſtinct in Name and Work from both the former, and the Deacon from all the reſt, as the formentioned Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare.</p>
               <p>Now if they have neither Name, nor Gifts of Chriſt's Miniſters, then can they be none of Chriſt's but another ſort of Miniſters: I do not ſay that a bare aſſuming, or owning a Man's ſelf to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, or Teacher, or Elder, will prove him one of Chriſt's Miniſters; but try what men are called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Office and Miniſtry of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:30532:119"/>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any ſhould Object and ſay, <hi>But are not theſe common names,</hi> viz. <hi>Paſtors, Elders, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Biſhops, and the like?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, In a common acceptation and uſe of the term they are, and may be ſo improved; but yet theſe names, are properly the names of Chriſt's diſtinct and peculiar Miniſters; and anſwerable to their proportionableneſs thereunto are they to be choſen into that very Miniſtry they are moſtly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and adapted for: As he whoſe Gift and Spirit moſtly diſpoſes him to <hi>Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Principles, received and believed, ought to be choſen into the Paſtor's Office; and he whoſe Gifts and Qualification bends moſt to Expound, Interpret, and open the ſenſe and meaning of the Word, is meeteſt to be choſen into the Office of a Teacher; and ſo he that is wiſe, zealous, grave, vigilant, and moſt diſpoſed to ſee the Churches Affairs done decently, and in order, is moſt meet for the Office of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uling-Elder, or Governor in the Church of Chriſt: And he that is moſt inclined to mercy, kindneſs, charity, bountifulneſs, liberality, and giving, is meeteſt of all the Church for the Office of Deaconſhip in the Church. For as <hi>Adam</hi> called every thing by its proper name; even ſo would the Second <hi>Adam</hi> have his Miniſters called by their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:30532:119"/>proper, not improper names; from their fitneſs and ſutableneſs to their Work choſen, and called either Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, or Deacons.</p>
               <p>But, laſtly; Would you know whether Perſons pretending to be Chriſt's Miniſters be ſo or no? ask them whoſe Servants they are, and whom they obey, Chriſt and his Will, or Man and his Will? For you know who ſaid it, <hi>His Servants ye are, to whom ye yeeld your ſelves obedient,</hi> Rom. 6.16. Now try whoſe Will and Mind Miniſters obey, Chriſt's or Man's; whoſe Word they walk by, Chriſt's or Man's; whoſe Worſhip they offer up, Chriſt's or Man's; <hi>For by their Fruits,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>you ſhall know whether men are true or falſe Prophets,</hi> Mat. 7.15, 16. Chriſt's Miniſters offer no ſtrange Fire, nor make any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to anoint God's Kings, Prieſts, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with, but according to divine Direction and Inſtitution; remembring that word, <hi>See that thou makeſt all things according to the pattern ſhewed to thee in the Mount,</hi> Heb. 8.8. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. Chriſt's Miniſters are to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter according to Chriſt's appointment, not Man's, for they are His and not Man's Servants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt teach themſelves and the People to obſerve all things that Chriſt hath commanded, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he hath not commanded to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or taught; Dare they obſerve or teach others to obſerve, as our Lord teacheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. and <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. ſaying, <hi>That which I received of the Lord, that delivered I alſo unto you, and nothing elſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt's Miniſters are not to ſeek what to do in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:30532:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Adminiſtration of their Office, but have all things plainly written in the Tables of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he which runneth may read his Duty; their Rule, is Scripture; their Help, the Spirit; their Work, Chriſt's inſtituted Will and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and their Ability and Sufficiency, the Grace and Gifts of the Spirit, and their Wages only the good Will of Chriſt's People, among whom they Iabour, they need not any man to teach them, but as that Anointing teacheth them all things; they can Pray without a Prayer-Book, and Preach without Common-Places, or the help of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, and Adminiſter Sacraments and Cenſures without a Directory or Book of Canons of Man's making, being throughly made wiſe, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furniſhed unto every good and Goſpel-Work, by Grace and Scripture, without any of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; they need no Garments of Diſtinction, nor ſhews of Piety, or Purity, or Gravity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Subſtance. Neither want they any vain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Ceremonies or Geſtures of Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, to make their Adminiſtrations appear beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and prove edifying; and yet all their things to be done decently, and according to due or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel order.</p>
               <p>Now if thus you pleaſe to try, and prove, or meaſure Chriſt's profeſſed Miniſters, and their Miniſtrations, by the Golden Reed of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you may certainly know who they are, that ſay they are Apoſtles and are not, but do lie, and as polluted; let all ſuch be put from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>'Tis theſe Wiſe-Preachers, and Goſpel-Miniſters
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:30532:120"/>that I only aſſert, ſpring from the good Will of Chriſt, and appertain to Chriſt; the reſt are but <hi>Apocrypha</hi>-Writing, and as groundleſs and uſeleſs, meet to be of all that belong to Chriſt the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>And this I ſuppoſe may be ſufficient for Goſpel-Miniſters, and the Miniſtrations Vindication, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any that ſhall dare to traduce or ſlander them as Incroachers and Intruders into other mens Work, and none of Chriſt's Miniſters, but a ſort of Factious, Schiſmatical and Heretical Perſons, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and turbulent or troubleſome to the Government.</p>
               <p>Yet let what hath been ſaid be but weighed and conſidered, and it will appear, that they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth from the one great Shepherd of the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. <hi>And, O how beautiful are the feet of ſuch who bring glad tydings of peace!</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:30532:121"/>then, as that great Preacher of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let us magnifie our Office, Rom.</hi> 11.13. Even by ſo doing, as he did, by labouring, if by any means we may provoke to emulation them that are our fleſh, and might ſave ſome of them. O let us who are Chriſt's, ſerve the great deſign of Chriſt; and let not us, as ſome do, ſerve our own Bellies, and not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. O, if not only our Miniſtry be of Chriſt, and from Chriſt, but a Miniſtry for Chriſt. O then, be exhorted to make it our great and main buſineſs, to ſeek not our own things or glory, but the things of our Lord Jeſus, and his great glory, to whom belongs all honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and bleſſing, for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> If we have his glory as great in our eye, then let our great buſineſs be, to get or procure his glory, as our Lord tells us he did before us, <hi>John</hi> 8.50. <hi>I ſeek not my own glory;</hi> yea, our bleſſed Lord makes it a Character of a true Miniſter, that he is thus minded, telling us, <hi>He that ſpeaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeketh his own glory; but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs in him,</hi> John 7.18. Servants muſt not ſo much, whilſt Servants, promote their own Intereſt and Credit as their Lord and Maſters; even no more ſhould we promote our own Glory or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the World but Chriſt's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let me Exhort you my Brethren, if you are Chriſt's Miniſters, and ſpring from him, then pray you approve your ſelves to him; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how you have received, and be faithful in

O conſider, he will not ſpare Levites, Prieſts, nor Miniſters of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> no more, no nor ſo much as others of the Houſe of <hi>Jacob:</hi> You know what is written, <hi>Then</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>This is it the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the People I will be glorified,</hi> Levit. 10.3. Wherefore let us be faithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the manifold Myſteries of God; let not us negleſt Chriſt's Work, nor corrupt his Work. <hi>Curſed is and ſhall he be that doth the Work of the Lord negligently, which is deceitfully; not doing as many which corrupt the Word of God; but of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.17.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer, Let me humbly offer a few things, which I would deſire all that are Chriſt's Miniſters to take ſpecial care of.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> Conſult often your Commiſſion, ponder your inſtruction for Miniſtration, and do not be a ſtranger to the Weight and Duty of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. If the Kingly Miniſtry had need daily to be Looking or Reading in the Book of the Law, what his Office and Duty towards God and the People is; as from that paſſage of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> was declared; certainly even ſo have Chriſt's Prieſtly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:30532:122"/>Miniſters much more need to ſtudy the Scripture, which are Chriſt's Book of Ordination that we may know how we ought to behave our ſelves in the Houſe of God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Study to know our o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and our own proper and peculiar Work.</hi> 'Tis, I fear, a cauſe of the wantingneſs of many, even Goſpel-Miniſters, That they are too much ignorant of this thing, even the Nature, Property, and Duty of their Office and Miniſtry; like perſons newly entered into the World, or the Affairs thereof; make more haſte to get into, than wiſely to conſider their Duty therein. Even ſo I fear is it with too many of us Preachers or Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus; They make more haſte to be Chriſt's Miniſters, than to conſult the great Duty of that Office and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let me offer this ſenſe; We are Chriſt's Miniſtry or Miniſters, and the Treaſure in our Earthen Veſſels is his, and none of ours: Then let us be careful of giving away any of Chriſt's our Sovereigns Right and Priviledges, who ever they be that demand it. Be like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who would not part with, nor leave in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> any thing of God's Portion, as we read in that paſſage <hi>Exod</hi> 9.16. <hi>There ſhall not an Hooſ be left behind us.</hi> And thus did <hi>Iſrael</hi> deal with the Kings of <hi>Canaan; So whomſoever the Lord our God ſhall drive out before us, them will we poſſeſs,</hi> Judg 11.24. Even ſo, give not away to any the right of your Sovereign Lord King Jeſus, whoſe Miniſters we are; divide not the living Child to pleaſe the Harlot;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:30532:122"/>I mean, mingle not Chriſt's and Antichriſt's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances together; Plow not with an Ox and an Aſs together; nor wear Linſey-Woolſey Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but remember, it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſow thy Vineyard with divers Seeds,</hi> (much leſs may we ſow God's Vineyard with divers Seeds) <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.9, 10, 11. For the Ark and <hi>Dagon,</hi> Chriſt our Lord, and <hi>Belial</hi> cannot agree together, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3, 4. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, the Lord our God is a Jealous God, and he will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> Though there are ſome whoſe Prudence, Moderation, and Zeal to Preaching, will permit them to do otherwiſe, namely, to mingle the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed, and do that they otherwiſe would not do; namely, to conform to men, that they may preach Chriſt to the People, Adminiſter Prayer and Sacraments by a formal Service-Book; Baptize all Children, even the Seed of the Adulterer and the Adultereſs; though God of old ſaid, <hi>Such Seed ſhall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord! to the tenth Generation,</hi> Deut. 23.2. Nay more, if all this was too little, they rather then ſtand out, will ſpread the Lord's Table for that Troop, which his Soul abhors, even a People that neither have nor can examine themſelves, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lord's Body; yet theſe muſt be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, and pay for it, or elſe be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</p>
               <p>Yea, to make the meaſure full, they dare med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Civil Actions, and deceive the People, as if to Marry and Bury the Dead, were part of the Adminiſtrations committed by Jeſus Chriſt into the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:30532:123"/>hand of his Miniſters; then which nothing is more falſe: For if it were unfit for ſome of Chriſt's Miniſters to tend the Tables of the Living, 'tis much more unmeet for any of Chriſt's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to tend the Dead, or intermmeddle with Civil Concerns, and Marry the living; but theſe paſs for pious, ſober, peaceable men; but let them remember, who ſaid, of two evils, they muſt chuſe the leaſt. 'Tis not to be taken of ſins, of clear and real ſins; for here we muſt chuſe nor take neither; for it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do evil that good may come thereof; for if we do, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is juſt,</hi> Rom. 3.18. 'Tis not wiſdom, but folly to conform againſt Conſcience to man's Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though to preach the Goſpel. 'Twere better to ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> If I muſt ſin, and unwillingly, and againſt Knowledge Conform that I may Preach, I will chuſe rather never to Preach, than to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and ſo to Preach. Theſe ſober men, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſober men, wiſe beyond ſobriety of Scripture, and drunken with the intoxicating Wine of the Whore of <hi>Rome's</hi> Cup, that thus ſtagger and reel up and down from one thing to another, even to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is uppermoſt in their dayes.</p>
               <p>Whether the men that thus do, be pious, I ſhall not determine; onely this I may ſafely conclude; Such mens practices, which we have hinted, are not pious practices, but impious and ungodly, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warranted and founded upon the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly;</hi> 'Twere well if this Zeal of theirs for Preaching be not but a blind Zeal, and a bad Zeal, a Zeal rather to preach out themſelves, and preach
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:30532:123"/>in themſelves, than to preach out Chriſt to or into the People. But becauſe I hope this Leaven of the Scribes and Phariſees, neither hath, nor ſhall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many of you, that are wiſe, even Spiritually-wiſe Preachers, I ſhall add no more to this but that word of <hi>Peter, Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> Acts 8.22. O Conforming Miniſters, if poſſible, repent of this your wicked conformity; and you, my dearly Beloved, who have yet eſcaped the corruption that is in the World through luſt; O, take you heed leſt you alſo be led away with the <hi>diſſimulations</hi> of ſuch.</p>
               <p>But once more, If you are Chriſt's Miniſters, and derive Office and Adminiſtration from him, then let me intreat you to provide for the Croſs, and be neither afraid nor aſhamed of it; for if they of the World called the Maſter of the Houſe <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> how much more ſhall they call them of his Houſhold? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.25. Think not much, in ſuch a day as this is, to be evil ſpoken of, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and ſlandered, knowing that theſe afflictions are already accompliſhed in your Brethren, and the beſt of Chriſt's Miniſters have met with no better uſage from the men of the Throne of Iniquity, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>I think that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a ſpectacle unto the World, and to Angels, and to Men: We are Fools for Chriſt's ſake; we are weak, we are deſpiſed: Even unto this very hour we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling places, and labour, working with our hands:
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:30532:124"/>Being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer it; being defamed, we intreat: We are made as the filth of the World, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. O ſtart not from your Miniſtry or Miniſtrations of the holy things of Chriſt, becauſe of ſuch things as theſe; knowing, that in and from the World you muſt have perſecution, if you be the Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. But ſay with <hi>Paul, None of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the Grace of God,</hi> Acts 20.24.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Laſtly;</hi> Let me offer this to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that are the Miniſters of Chriſt; Be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and reſolved Enemies to the Miniſters and Miniſtrations of Antichriſt; take part with Chriſt, and <hi>follow him upon white Horſes, clothed in fine linnen, white and clean,</hi> Rev. 19.14. <hi>Say not a confederacy to all them to whom this people ſhall ſay a confederacy,</hi> Iſa. 8.12. But remember that charge, <hi>Put you ſelves in array againſt</hi> Babylon <hi>round about; all ye that bend the Bow, ſhoot at her, ſpare no Arrows, for ſhe hath ſinned againſt the Lord,</hi> Jer. 50.14. Ye Angels of Chriſt, <hi>Pour out the Vials of the Wrath of God upon the Earth;</hi> even upon this Babyloniſh Earth; Pour out your Vials, filled not with yours, but the Lord's wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.1. 'Tis juſt work to deſtroy Babylon, <hi>For ſhe hath ſinned, and hath corrupted the Kings and the Inhabitants of the Earth, and hath made
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:30532:124"/>even all Nations drunk with the Wine of the Cup of her Fornications,</hi> Rev. 18.3. <hi>Strip her, and make her naked as in the day ſhe was born; for in her will be found the blood of the Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the Earth,</hi> Rev. 18.24. <hi>Diſcover, by a light of Scripture, her Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and lay open the filthineſs of her Skirts, the beaſtlineſs of her Power, the earthlineſs of her Church and Members,</hi> Chap. 13.12, 13, 14, 16. <hi>Shew and diſcover the nature and vileneſs of her Locuſts, or Clergy-Men,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>Diſcover their even killing Wormwood, or bitterneſs of her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Doctrine,</hi> Chap. 8.10, 11. Shew that ſhe is the great Whore, great Cheat, and greateſt Enemy that ever the Lord Jeſus or his People had or ſhall have; even the ſame power of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which put our Lord, them, and his Saints now to death. <hi>Bid defiance to her, and to all her Power, and all her Romiſh Trinkets; and cry aloud to all the people of God, to have neither more nor leſs to do with her; but ſpeedily to obey that voice, Come out of her my people, partake not of her ſins, leſt that ye partake alſo of her plagues,</hi> Chap. 18.4. Never think of her Repentance, for <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, and ſhall be hidden from her eyes: She is none of thoſe Whores that know how to be aſhamed, or repent,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.21, 22. She is the great Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor againſt the Crown and Dignity of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord King Jeſus; no ſuch Treaſon hath been hatched or plotted againſt the Lord Jeſus through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the World, as in and by the Roman Church and Synagogue. Therefore plead you Worthies of the Lord with her, and againſt her, and pray
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:30532:125"/>without ceaſing. Down with her, down with her, down with her, as a Mill-ſtone into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, and let her never riſe any more, and ſet Faith and Patience to work in this caſe; for is it not written, <hi>And they overcame him by the Blood of the Lamb, and the word of their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and they loved not their lives unto the death; and he that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; he that killeth with the Sword, muſt be killed with the Sword. Here is the Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 12.11. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 13.10.</p>
               <p>O therefore, to conclude, Let all the Goſpel-Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus this day in the World be <hi>Antipaſſes,</hi> men for Chriſt, but againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and whatſoever is truly of Antichriſt both Root and Branch.</p>
               <p>So much for the firſt part of this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> which was to the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let me now cloſe with a few cloſing words to the Churches and Servants of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt's Miniſters ſpring from him, and both they and their Miniſtrations depend upon him, and are given of him for the good of you his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then let me exhort you, who are the Churches and Servants of Chriſt, to two or three things, and ſo I ſhall conclude this Doctrine, and the Text, becauſe I would not be too prolix.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> Be you Chriſt's Porters, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of making Chriſt's Servants his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Be very careful and circumſpect to whom
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:30532:125"/>you open the Door, or a Door of Entrance or Admittance in any Office of Miniſtry under the Lord Jeſus. Be ſure you conſult diligently your Charter, the New-Teſtament Inſtitution concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters; and when you are to chuſe any, be ſure you ask Wiſdom of God, who giveth liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upbraideth not, <hi>James</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Set your thoughts and choice onely upon ſuch men as are of honeſt report, and full of the Holy Ghoſt and Wiſdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Chuſe men competently, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endued with ſuch Gifts, as may truly enable and furniſh them unto Miniſtry, yea, unto that particular ſort of Miniſtry whereunto you ordain and appoint them, whether it be to the Office of Teacher, Paſtor, Elder, or Deacon; do not chuſe idle Shepherds into the place of Chriſt's Shepherds, ſuch as may wear the Name of Chriſt's Miniſters, but want the Gifts of Chriſt's Miniſters; ſuch will exerciſe the Inſtruments of fooliſh Shepherds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, rather than of Wiſe Miniſters or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and be like neither Goads or Nails to you. Yea further, be very circumſpect that you miſtake not the Gifts of your Miniſters, and appoint them to that Miniſtry in particular, which though they have Gifts for Miniſtry, yet may not have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Gift of that Miniſtry you chuſe them for; for every one hath his proper Gift of God, that fits and diſpoſes Perſons for ſome one or other particular work, not for every, or all the works to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his Church. It were to make your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters lying Signs, and like tinkling Braſs, and a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:30532:126"/>ſounding Cimbal, to appoint them to one Miniſtry, when their Grace and Gift propenſes and diſpoſes them to another. Therefore as you would honour Chriſt, or have him honoured by his and your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, be careful and wary in this particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Watch over your Miniſters that watch over you in the Lord, that they make full proof of their Miniſtry, and fulfil it in the Lord; leſt your watchleſneſs over them, make them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be watchleſs over themſelves, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and you alſo, and ſo you partake of other mens ſins, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> You that want ſuch, and may enjoy them, neglect not ſo great a Mercy, neither hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt of ſo great a Glory, as the Glory of his own Miniſtry in his own Church, through your want of Zeal and forwardneſs to promote his and your own concern; but I ſhall hope I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly;</hi> If Chriſt's Miniſters flow from him, and depend upon him, then when you enjoy them, bleſs and magnifie him for them, who hath not left you Orphans, or as Sheep without a Shepherd. Wiſe Goſpel-Miniſters ſuch as we have all along been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of, are very great bleſſings to a People that enjoy them. Wherefore, when God loves a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he promiſeth them that <hi>he will ſet Watchmen upon their Walls, which ſhall never hold their peace day nor night; and alſo that their Teachers ſhall no more be removed into Corners,</hi> Iſa. 62.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30, 20.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:30532:126"/>Therefore you that enjoy wiſe, faithful, able, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Goſpel-Miniſters, bleſs God, through Jeſus Chriſt, for this ſingular Gift of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But again, Are Miniſters of the Goſpel ſuch as have been deſcribed Chriſt's Gift and Ordinance, both they and their Miniſtrations? then let none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude or impoſe upon you, the Churches of Chriſt, a Miniſtry, or Miniſtrations, which are none of Chriſts, nor to be found contained in Scripture; but being free, be not the Servants of Men, but remember <hi>Paul</hi>'s Counſel; <hi>Beware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and after the rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt. Let no man at his pleaſure bear rule over you by humbleneſs of mind, and worſhipping of Angels, intruding into theſe things, which he hath not ſeen, vainly puffed up by his fleſhly mind,</hi> Col. 2.8, 18.</p>
               <p>Further, let me, in the fear of the God, Exhort you, that injoy Chriſt's Miniſtry and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; <hi>Remember to obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you,</hi> Heb. 13.17. Their Work is hard enough from the men of this World. O, let it be good from you for whom they endure all things, or at leaſt very many things, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. They do not only do much for you, but alſo endure much for you. O! therefore, let them not indure any thing from you, but rather, according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially ſuch as labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:30532:127"/>remembring what is ſaid concerning them, <hi>without the leaſt ſhadow of pride or vanity. How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad-tyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of peace,</hi> Rom. 10.15. Now if you would eminently honour and rejoyce your Miniſters, pray then labour greatly to improve and profit by their Adminiſtrations; for ſuch as are Chriſt's faithful Miniſters, ſeek not yours but you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. and have no greater joy, than to hear that their Children walk in or according to truth, 3 <hi>John</hi> 4. This makes great rejoycing and thankſgiving by Chriſt's Miniſters, when they either hear or ſee, that thoſe they labour among do proſper, and their graces grow, as we have it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Wherefore I alſo, when I heard of your Faith in the Lord Jeſus, and love unto all the Saints, ceaſe not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</hi> whereas to find the Saints and Churches of Chriſt, in a poor, low, beggarly ſtate of Soul, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving nor profiting under means of Grace, this will cauſe Chriſt and his Miniſters to weep and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and even ſit down and bemoan themſelves in the ſenſe of it, according to that propheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.7. <hi>Behold, their valiant ones ſhall cry without; the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Peace ſhall weep bitterly,</hi> fulfilled by this Prophet the Type of Chriſt. <hi>Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vain,</hi> Chap. 49.4. And how fully was this Propheſie made good by Chriſt, who, <hi>when he was come near, he beheld the City and wept over it,</hi> Luke 19.41. Wherefore Sirs, if you have any love to Chriſt, or compaſſion towards your Miniſters, improve them, and ſtrive to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:30532:127"/>under their Miniſtration, ſo will you prevent their grief, and give them a good reward for their labour.</p>
               <p>But again, to haſten to a concluſion, and cloſing up of the Uſe of Exhortation; pray you, if your Miniſters be Chriſt's Miniſters, and Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters flow from him, depend upon him, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for him; pray you joyn with, and aſſiſt them in what-ever they for Chriſt have need of you; as <hi>Paul</hi> directed the Church of the <hi>Romans, To do for</hi> Phebe, <hi>that ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh Saints, and that ye aſſiſt her in whatſoever buſineſs ſhe hath need of you,</hi> Rom. 16.2. So ſay I, pray aſſiſt your Miniſters with your watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with your obſervation of thoſe they labour among and for. Help them with your <hi>Informations,</hi> concerning what you obſerve wanting either in them or others. Help them with your Zeal and readineſs, to joyn iſſue with them in any buſineſs of Chriſt, like thoſe Holy Ones we read of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.1. <hi>Then wrought</hi> Bezaleel <hi>and</hi> Aholiab, <hi>and every wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man, in whom the Lord put wiſdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to know how to work all manner of work, for the ſervice of the Sanctuary, according to all that the Lord commanded.</hi> The like frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we read of in thoſe mentioned, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.5, 6. with <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.18. where the People of the Lord are found thus doing; <hi>And they ſaid, Let us riſe up and build: So they ſtrengthened their hands for this good Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:30532:128"/>But laſtly; Pray you, let me Exhort you to aſſiſt Miniſters with your Prayers for their good, and the proſperity of Chriſt's work in their hand; remembring, <hi>That whilſt</hi> Moſes<hi>'s hands were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litld by</hi> Aaron <hi>and</hi> Hur, <hi>Iſrael prevailed,</hi> Exod. 17.11, 12. Even ſo my Brethren, your inceſſant Prayers in your Miniſters behalf, will utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow <hi>Amalek,</hi> and help <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> to prevail.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and with what I ſhall offer to your conſideration upon this Scripture; wherein I have, with what clearneſs and brevity conveniently I could, ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you what Preaching is, and whoſe Ordinance it is; who is a truly wiſe Preacher, and what his Work is; and the Bleſſing and Duty of all that enjoy ſuch Preachers.</p>
               <p>Now conſider and examine what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give you wiſdom in all things. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
